11/5/2024,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"My wife and I purchased a sectional from Rooms to Go approximately 3 years ago. They had a promotion of no interest on a 5 year payment plan. Our payment was $ XXXX which we have always been paid on time to Synchrony. 
Synchrony decided to change certain policies regarding paper statements that we were not aware of. They claim it was written in our statement in XXXX but we never saw it. Since we knew our payments would always be {$57.00} a month we did not notice they were adding a paper statement fee of {$1.00} per month to our payment beginning in XXXX. Therefore our XXXX statement was {$58.00} instead of {$57.00}. 
When we realized in XXXX that we had a {$90.00} statement, my wife called regarding the extra fees. They explained that we did not pay the total amount in XXXX of {$58.00} and were being assessed a {$30.00} late fee for the unpaid balance of {$1.00}. 
My wife agreed to pay the 2 months paper fee for XXXX and XXXX ( {$3.00} ) but asked synchrony to forgive the late fees. It was her understanding that this was approved. She remembers asking the operator "" So I just need to pay you {$4.00}? '' My wife also agreed to stop the paper statements and have them sent by email. She did not know that Synchrony would be sending the email statements to XXXX 's address so did not know that Synchrony was still adding late fees on to our payment. 
She continued paying {$57.00} each month but Synchrony is saying we now owe {$140.00}. ( {$88.00} in fees ). My wife and I talked with Synchrony today and they insist we must pay these penalty charges. We offered to pay off the entire balance of the sectional but are not willing to pay penalty charges. They refused to comply.

We feel that we have been wrongly charged of these fees for 2 reasons. We pay our bills online and have paid Synchrony {$57.00} a month for years. It is completely understandable that we would not know about the {$1.00} fee they randomly decided to add to our bill. Even though we felt this was unethical for a bank to just decide to add a fee to a customers bill, we agreed to pay the {$1.00} for 2 months and have our statements sent by email. 
The second reason is we are being charged late fees on previous late fees. This was supposedly cleared up by my wife 's initial phone call to Synchrony that the late fees would be removed if she paid the {$3.00} in added paper statement fees. {$4.00} was sent to Synchrony on XX/XX/year>.

I can clearly explain why in this complaint. This is in regards to Wells Fargo case number XXXX. The dispute was opened around XX/XX/XXXX. They denied my claim today on XX/XX/XXXX without ever sending it to the merchant 's bank and requesting any evidence or documentation. They should have done this according to XXXX guidelines as I already attempted to resolve this matter directly with the merchant. Wells Fargo is aware of this due to the signed forms they requested from me which I faxed back on XX/XX/XXXX. According to research on the internet, XXXX demands that the issuing bank requests supporting documentation or evidence from the merchant and/or merchant 's bank. If the merchant and/or merchant 's bank is unable to provide any supporting documents or evidence that they did provide the consumer then it should result in an automated reversal in favor of the consumer. However, Wells Fargo has told me the exact opposite of this. They are telling me that it is my responsibility to provide supporting documentation that I did not receive what I paid for. They said without this, they can not move forward with the dispute. I told them it was their responsibility as my bank to request that from the merchant, and that they have it backwards. The Wells Fargo Executive Customer Relation agent today I spoke to at XXXX told me that I need to call the claims team and request to have my claim reopened, and that I must provide documentation that I did NOT get what I paid for.

Legal Basis for Refund Request Under 15 U.S.C. 1666d, creditors are required to : 1. Credit the amount of a credit balance to the consumers account, 2. Refund any remaining credit balance upon request, and 3. Perform this action in good faith. 

As part of this request, I assert my rights to the refund of all applicable credit balances associated with this account. 

Additionally, as defined by the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), a credit card under 15 U.S.C. 1602 ( k ) includes any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device used for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit. In this transaction, my Social Security card was used, and it falls within this statutory definition.

My Rights Under 15 U.S.C. 1666i As a credit card customer, I am further protected under 15 U.S.C. 1666i, which allows cardholders to assert claims and defenses in disputes arising from credit card transactions. This provision reinforces my right to a refund as a credit card customer under federal law. 

Supporting Documentation I have included relevant documentation and attachments to support my request. These include : Evidence of the transaction and credit balance with you financial data base. 
Consumer Credit Transaction loan aggreement with finance charge accurately showing amounts due. 


Request for Action Please consider this letter as my formal request to process a refund of the remaining finance charge or any other credit balance on my account. I trust USAA will act promptly and in good faith to address this matter.

Customer Service Issues : I contacted Prepaidgiftbalance.com 's customer service to resolve these issues. However, they requested information on the state in which the card was purchased, which was unexpected and not helpful in resolving the matter.

Lack of Resolution : Despite my efforts, the company has not offered any assistance or taken responsibility for the malfunctioning card. Their failure to resolve the issue or provide any alternative solutions has been highly frustrating, and I believe this may indicate fraudulent practices.

This situation has led to financial loss, as I am unable to access the funds on the card. I request that the CFPB investigate Prepaidgiftbalance.com for potential fraud and consumer rights violations to prevent further harm to others facing similar issues. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

11/13/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Fees or costs during the application process,"I have had multiple issues with this company after being sent to them through a refinance. I had been paying XXXX since the refinance in XXXX of XXXX as was agreed to on as part of the refinance. They had apparently given the wrong escrow amount without informing me and so on XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that my payment was being raised to XXXX due to a shortage. 

I am going through another refinance to lower the cost again as rates have gone down and have run into a new issue with the company. I started the refinance process in XXXX of 2024 and had all of the paper signed by the end of the month. I had frozen payments for XXXX so that the refinance company could handle the situation with the refinance. I was called on the XXXX of XXXX stating that my monthly payment was due but explained that the refinance process has started and may be taking some time to fully process. There were no issues until the XXXX of XXXX when I receive a call that a new amount, XXXX was due by the end of the day. I was informed this was because of a shortage due to a tax disbursement. I verified with multiple agents at "" lakeview loan servicing - mr.cooper '' that this was the correct amount. I discussed with two online assistants about where the payment came from and if the two companies, "" lakeview loan servicing - mr. XXXX '' and "" village capital and investments '' had ever discussed this payment. When given information about contact to "" village capital and investment, '' I was told that there was no communication between the two companies. They said that "" village capital and investments '' should have been notified by them about making this disbursement payment, however in the next line, they say that they didn't have to notify them about it since the payoff had not been made. So they neglected to make them aware of this. There was absolutely no way any party would have had this knowledge except for them. 

They also said that I could have made the note to stop this disbursement instead since taxes were always due in XXXX, something that I was unaware of as I haven't been with the company for more than a year. 

I checked each tab to find the monetary amounts and not one of them shows this XXXX number so there was no way that I could have known. Now I have to make this payment when I don't have the money otherwise the settlement will not process. I will find a way to make the payment today, the XXXX of XXXX. This has been an absolutely horrible experience with this company. Their negligence in their duties has caused me additional payments when the refinance was made to reduce the financial burden I was already suffering from.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LAKEVIEW LOAN SERVICING, LLC",NC,285XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/13/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10786050

However, the apartment complex withheld my security deposit totaling {$1200.00} and stated I owed an additional $ XXXX for cleaning costs. I requested a detailed breakdown of these charges, as I am familiar with standard move-out costs in the leasing industry. I can confirm that my unit was left in excellent condition, with only minor wall holes from picture frames and a TV mount. The complex did not provide a response with any explanation or itemization. 

Furthermore, although state assistance of over {$5000.00} was issued to the apartment complex on my behalf, it appears that none of this amount was applied to the final move-out balance. While the state informed me that any non-rent-related charges would be my responsibility, I was alarmed that move-out and cleaning costs were calculated at an excessive almost {$1700.00}. Neither my caseworker nor I received any further clarification from the complex, and the matter was subsequently forwarded to collections without proper resolution. 

Once assigned to ProCollect, I received no written notification of the debt, nor was I afforded the opportunity to request verification of the debt as required under Colorado tenant laws and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Despite multiple dispute attempts, ProCollect has not acknowledged or validated my requests.

11/6/2024,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened to sue you for very old debt,"Formal Complaint Against CKS Prime Investments , LLC and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXs I am filing a formal complaint against CKS Prime Investments , LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for improper debt collection practices, including violations of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), Regulation Z, the Credit CARD Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Context Background : On XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a letter from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  notifying me that my account ( ending in XXXX ) with an outstanding balance of {$1000.00} had been charged off and sold to CKS Prime Investments , LLC. 
CKS is now attempting to collect this debt, including {$700.00} in overlimit charges. I did not receive prior notice of these charges from XXXX, and the account number referenced by CKS does not match the account number originally provided by XXXX. 
Overlimit Charges : I did not opt in to permit transactions exceeding my credit limit, nor was I adequately informed about such charges. The imposition of overlimit fees without explicit consent may violate the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( i ), and its implementing Regulation Z, 12 CFR Part 1026.56.

Statute of Limitations : The debt was charged off on XX/XX/year>, and the statute of limitations for collecting credit card debt in Texas is four years. Pursuing collection beyond this period may violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and its implementing Regulation F, 12 CFR Part 1006.26.

Unreasonable Billing Cycle : CKS applied a XXXX billing cycle during a XXXX month, which gave me insufficient time to review my statement and make payments. This action led to overlimit and potentially late fees, which I believe violate TILA, Regulation Z, and FDCPA Section 1692f. 
Improper Service of Process : The process server who delivered the lawsuit papers failed to validate my identity, age, or residency at the address where service was attempted. This interaction was recorded for evidence. The process server only identified themselves as a process server without disclosing their affiliation, raising concerns about the validity of the service. 

This letter pertains to the debt associated with the account ending in 1455, for which CKS claims a balance of {$1000.00} ( {$320.00} actual credit card balance, plus {$700.00} in overlimit fees ). The following points require clarification and documentation : 1. Overlimit Fees and Lack of Consent : I did not opt in to allow transactions exceeding my credit limit, nor was I properly notified about overlimit fees. These actions violate TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( i ), and Regulation Z, 12 CFR Part 1026.56.

2. Statute of Limitations : The debt was charged off on XX/XX/year>, and Texass statute of limitations for collecting credit card debt is four years. CKSs actions may violate Regulation F, 12 CFR Part 1006.26, which prohibits time-barred collections. 
3. Unreasonable Billing Cycle : CKS imposed a XXXX billing cycle during a XXXX month, which I believe to be an unfair and deceptive practice under FDCPA Section 1692f and a violation of Regulation Z under TILA. 
4. Lack of Debt Validation and Misleading Practices : Upon receiving collection notices from CKS, I requested validation of the debt as required by FDCPA Section 1692g. However, CKS failed to provide adequate documentation or clear itemization of the charges. This lack of validation and misleading communication may violate FDCPA Section 1692e, which prohibits false or misleading representations. 
5. Improper Service of Process : The process server failed to properly identify themselves or verify my identity during the service of legal documents, raising concerns about the validity of the legal proceedings initiated by CKS.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Velocity Portfolio Group,TX,76549,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/6/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10709587

11/13/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"This is a 2nd mortgage, last year we were notified that it was being transferred from Newrez to Shellpoint Loan/ mortgage Servicing but they are one and the same company. the first payment to Shellpoint was due on XX/XX/XXXX, we were told we didn't need to change anything. 
A few months ago our mortgage statements began stating we were behind in payments and that they had not received any money from us. The monthly payment is always {$420.00} per month. 
We have a weekly auto pay set up for {$100.00} from our checking account straight to them, we have never been late nor missed any payments. 
We immediately called customer services and learned that the weekly installments we set up with Newrez are incompatible with the Shellpoint billing system, causing our payments to be held in an unapplied or missapplied queue. Evidently their system can not not see the payments until an employee manually moves them to the loan account and this only occurs when we call. The first time this happened we offered to change to bi-weekly installments but their CSR said we needn't change anything as now they knew we were paying weekly it would not happen again, but it has continued to happen and we have had to call several times to ask that the money be applied to our loan. Now it seems some payments are missing or lost in their system and are not applied even when we call. 
Each time we call the CSR takes a long time to review our payments and ultimately agrees that we are current and not delinquent. 
I see some changes were made following my most recent telephone conversation with them XXXX but the payment history on their site is impossible to decipher and the XXXX statement still shows we are behind - as will the XXXX one I am sure..

I have never conducted business with Zion Debt Holdings, nor have I entered into any financial arrangement or credit agreement with this company. Their unauthorized reporting on my credit report constitutes a breach of privacy, causing significant and unjust harm to my credit score and adversely affecting both my business and personal financial endeavors.

Specific Violations : Privacy Violation : Zion Debt Holdings is reporting an account on my credit report without my knowledge or consent, in violation of privacy protections outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681b, companies must have a legitimate and authorized reason to access or report information on a consumer 's credit file. Zion Debt Holdings has no such reason, as I have no legitimate account or relationship with them.

Negative Impact on Credit Score and Financial Harm : This fraudulent account has caused a substantial decrease in my credit score, directly affecting my ability to conduct business and pursue personal financial projects. The reporting of this unverified account has led to financial losses and reputational harm, as lenders now view my credit profile as less favorable, impacting my opportunities and standing.

FCRA Requirements and Due Diligence : Zion Debt Holdings has failed to comply with FCRA mandates requiring accurate and verified reporting of consumer information. According to the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ), all information supplied to credit bureaus must be accurate and verifiable. Zion Debt Holdings has disregarded these requirements by reporting false information without substantiating the accounts legitimacy or providing proof of my responsibility for this debt. 
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Violations : If Zion Debt Holdings has accessed my information or pursued collection actions, they may also be in violation of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692, which prohibits deceptive and misleading practices in debt collection. Reporting an account with no valid grounds or contractual basis constitutes misleading and harmful behavior, prohibited under the FDCPA.

Resolution Requested : Immediate Investigation and Removal : I request that the CFPB conduct an investigation into Zion Debt Holdings for their unauthorized and fraudulent reporting practices and demand the immediate removal of this account from my credit report. 
Cease and Desist : Zion Debt Holdings must cease any further collection activities or credit reporting actions related to this unauthorized account and must not share or access my private information again without verifiable cause. 
Financial and Reputational Remediation : I seek full remediation for the harm caused to my credit and reputation, including any damages resulting from this false reporting.

11/19/2024,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Sued you in a state where you do not live or did not sign for the debt,"I have complaint which includes two parts, and each has several "" deceptive practices '' associated with it. 

Part I. The first has to do with suing me without providing sufficient evidence ( no document signed by either party was ever presented yet the judge initiated a lawsuit ).

Case Summary : I submitted this to the state bar of Texas but my lawsuit has still been moved to a pre-trial hearing on XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX. A lawsuit was filed on me on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and I received the paperwork on or around XXXX XXXX. The plaintiff was XXXX XXXX XXXX and the suit was filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX of the Peace XXXX. The judge is named XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX suit is about the purchase of a laptop from Best Buy, with financing being provided by Citibank. The debt was sold by Citibank to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The paperwork filed included only an invoice which was for an amount far greater than the original purchase price and cited an interest rate of 30 %. There was no copy of a contract included in the paperwork, nor was anything signed by either party included in the paperwork. Based upon this, I have grave concerns that literally anyone could walk into a court, produce a phony invoice, and be granted a lawsuit against me ( or anyone else for that matter ). This lawsuit, XXXX, is based on insufficient evidence ( no signed contract or supporting documentation ). 

XXXX. Because of this lawsuit, the door was opened to many attorneys for further actions. And despite the lack of evidence, multiple attorneys ( at least ten ) solicited me via threatening letters. Indeed, had I accepted a deal offered me by XXXX XXXX XXXX, I would have paid close to twice the original purchase price without any essential evidence of wrongdoing ever having been presented because of this attempted intimidation. 

XXXX. Allegations : o Coercive Solicitation : Attorneys threatened liens, garnishment, and severe financial consequences to induce me to hire them. 

o Unreasonable Fees : One attorney demanded {$750.00} and claimed they could "" negotiate '' the case down, without ever having even talked with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Not only did this firm presume my guilt without ever asking me whether I wished to plead innocent, the amount projected would have still resulted in me losing over twice the original amount of the dispute. Most of the money would have been paid to the two lawyers involved, and I suspect collusion, perhaps even based upon previous experience, is possible. 

o Potential Collusion : The presiding judge granted the lawsuit despite insufficient evidence. I suspect possible collusion between the attorneys and the plaintiff or judge, given the swift approval and subsequent solicitations. I have written my own motion to dismiss I am not a lawyer - but I fear submitting it to this precinct for I do not believe that I can get a fair hearing from this judge given the above. 

5. Supporting Evidence : o I submitted copies of 2 threatening solicitation letters.

o I also submitted the paperwork I received via the law suit. No signed coument, by either party, was included in the paperwork.

6. Relief Requested : o Investigate the attorneys conduct for potential violations of professional ethics.

o Determine if these attorneys have a history of filing baseless lawsuits or engaging in coercive practices. 
o Investigate whether these practices, taken together, constitute extortion.

Part II. The actual transaction.

a. ) The use of credit in this transaction is absolutely inappropriate for me and should never have occurred. I have purchased several laptops previously through Best Buy and paid them all off, but never once was any transaction accompanied by a credit card. Furthermore, I had enough money in my bank account to purchase this item several times over, without any payments. Citibank provided the financing, and at an egregiously high ( 30 % ) rate according to the legal filing. 

In addition, I do not even own a credit card! I make all of my purchases for my auto, my residence, my insurance, etc. literally everything that I purchase - through my checking account and one debit card. I think I may have one experience in my life with a credit card - a Macys card which, upon finding a disgustingly high rate of interest I was to be charged, I cut up and destroyed. In sum, I question why this abrupt change in the terms of a transaction was ever appropriate for me. 

b. ) Even if there is a contract regarding this transaction, it can not capture all of the conditions present at the time the transaction took place. Again, I will suggest that several deceptive practices were in place. 

b1. As mentioned above, having never experienced a credit transaction with this firm, I had no reason to expect that credit was being offered. It was a deceptive practice to offer one under these circumstances.

b2. The explanation at the time of sale was also inadequate and I never had knowledge that a credit transaction was being offered. As I recall, the salesman at Best Buy conducting this transaction offered me a credit card as a perquisite perhaps as a reward to a repeat buyer. In fact, the way I remember it being presented to me was that it was a reward for my continued purchase of laptops at Best Buy and, therefore, could have been applied to any future purchases. Had I known that the transaction in question was to be subject to additional interest charges based upon some credit extension, I would never have agreed to this purchase. 

b3. My subsequent behaviors are very consistent with this state of knowledge. I distinctly remember leaving Best But that day in XX/XX/XXXX thinking that I had just made a purchase for which monthly payments of about {$35.00} would be assessed. And, as I understood the transaction, interest was to be recovered in that consistent monthly payment. Subsequently, I earnestly made 17 months of {$35.00} payments. I made them for 17 months on time and without fail. 

It may be that at some point in time after the purchase, Citibank may have attempted to contact me. I literally do not know. I had no reason to respond, even if they did attempt to contact me, as I was secure in the knowledge that I was making my {$35.00} per month payments. I did not anticipate any additional charges and would not have been seeking them out. 

After I had made 17 payments, I attempted to contact Citibank, not to find out about any interest rates, but to find out when the payments would end. My payments totalled {$590.00}, a substantial part of the original purchase price ( think about it - a relatively low end ordinary laptop! ) Though I do not have the exact numbers in front of me, I believe that those 17 payments constituted most of the initial price. However, I learned then that their interest payments had not only obviated all of my monthly payments but contributed to a rise in my account which made the balance close to the original purchase price. In other words, I had been paying for 17 months, but my balance was close to the original purchase price with which I began. Now, a year and half after that time, the additional interest charges they have tacked on certainly exceed the original purchase price. This seemed ( and still seems ) absolutely absurd to me. Therefore, I stopped payments on this purchase. 

b4. The Citibank customer service was terrible and they withheld information about what and how I was being charged from me! After 17 months, when I contacted their customer service department, I asked for access to a website where I could see the individual charges and transactions, but that was denied. They offered to send me, by mail, a copy of this evidence, but I never received it. To this day, I have not seen a detailed record of what they did or how they did it, yet they see fit to bring a lawsuit against me. I also offered to pay off the principal over the phone whatever was remaining of the original purchase price after subtracting my payments- but they refused to consider this as well. At this point, I gave up even trying to discuss this matter with Citibank. 

b5. After this contact, Citibank harassed me for two solid months every day dunning me for the payments. This harassment was conducted systematically and deliberately and was manifested as daily text messages on my phone.

b6. Rather than ever addressing the original cause of the problem, Citibank chose to sell this to another firm. In doing so, they absolve themselves from further responsibility, and without ever addressing the original problem. There are mechanisms by which Citibank and Best Buy could collect information from customers interviews, focus groups, customer service reps, etc. However, these two firms are deliberately absolving themselves of any responsibility for correcting errors in the transaction that they committed. They choose to punish rather than listen to customers! By doing so -they forego the opportunity for improvement in this aspect of transaction for a large number of transactions, -they escalate costs for everyone. Those costs not only rise is a non-linear manner, they fall most heavily on me, an individual, rather than on the deep-pocketed firms who have caused this debacle. 
-they also avoid the negative reputation that might result as some heavy-handed tactics ( e.g., the lawsuit and threats of garnishment and liens ) seemed to commence only after they sold the suit. 

b7. In retrospect, it also appears to me that these firms were attempting to run up the price of the transaction onto which they attach interest. There was a {$200.00} charge for a one-year XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on a new laptop, for which the maintenance contract should not have been necessary ) which was included in the purchase price and subject to the high interest rates as well. 

In sum, I never needed, wanted, requested or even knew of the interest that was to be charted on this purchase. I left Best Buy thinking that my monthly payments of {$35.00} included an interest rate, not that I would be subject to additional payments into which enormous interest rates were incorporated. 

Finally, I believe that it is also ridiculous that the firm XXXX XXXX is asking to be compensated for any additional charges here. Had this transaction been handled properly up front by Citibank and Best Buy, there would be no additional costs. That Citibank and Best Buy are not incurring them is even more evidence that they are avoiding the responsibility that inheres in legitimate business transactions, and I can see no reason for any additional costs to be paid by me. 

I am not guilty of whatever charges are being brought against me, and I should not be charged anything further by these firms. I would also like to remind the CFBP that it takes time and effort to formulate my own defense and to communicate it, and this case has caused me emotional distress as well.

11/23/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Unexpected increase in interest rate,"Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Unjust Charges and Credit Card Mismanagement by Best Buy and Citibank Dear CFPB Team, I am writing to formally file a complaint against Best Buy and Citibank regarding unfair credit card charges and the negative impact on my credit score resulting from their actions. 

Background : 1. In XXXX I purchased a television from Best Buy over the phone. During the transaction, the Best Buy representative offered me a store credit card with a limit exceeding {$4000.00}, which was managed by Citibank. I agreed to this and provided my necessary information. 
2. I explicitly requested that the full cost of the television, approximately {$1200.00}, be charged to the credit card immediately upon purchase. Instead, they processed only the minimum monthly payment, without informing me or obtaining my consent for this arrangement. 
3. At no point during the transaction or afterward did I receive any documentation from Best Buy or Citibank detailing the terms of the credit card, including interest rates, grace periods, or repayment policies. 

Discovery of the Issue : Over two years later, I discovered that Citibank was still charging me monthly payments, despite my understanding that I had already paid off the original {$1200.00} charge. When I contacted Citibank to investigate : They informed me that I had exceeded the promotional period for interest-free payments and was being charged retroactive interest. 
I explained that I had requested the {$1200.00} charge to be paid in full at the time of purchase and suggested they review the call records to confirm my statement. However, they claimed that the call records were no longer available. 
To make matters worse, after the issue arose, Citibank sent me a backlog of invoices and statements covering the previous two years. These documents were never sent to me during the original period, depriving me of any opportunity to notice or address the problem earlier. 

My Attempts to Resolve the Issue : 1. I offered to settle the matter by paying an additional {$200.00} as a goodwill gesture, but Citibank refused. 
2. They subsequently closed my credit card account, reported me to the credit bureaus as a delinquent account, and significantly damaged my credit score. This has negatively impacted my employment opportunities. 
3. Afterward, third-party collection agencies began contacting me for payment, suggesting that Citibank sold the debt without resolving the dispute. 

My Request : I firmly believe I have been treated unfairly and subjected to predatory lending practices. The lack of transparency regarding the credit card terms, refusal to investigate the original phone call, and unjust reporting to credit bureaus have caused significant financial and professional harm. 

I respectfully request CFPBs assistance in : 1. Investigating this matter thoroughly.

2. Holding Best Buy and Citibank accountable for their actions.

Both companies are known as grifter type mortgage companies that intentionally tries to raise your household expenses until you can't afford your mortgage any longer. The first scam that Shellpoint attempted to do was purchase mortgage insurance on our home without our consent.

My wife and I found out today that our property taxes were not paid for this year. The tax bill was sent to Shellpoint in XXXX by means of certified letter. They intentionally didn't pay the taxes and received the tax bill in ample time. All homeowners connected to these grifters are suffering the same hardships. They need to be stopped.

The lack of urgency and repeated delays in processing this matter have caused unnecessary stress and delayed critical repairs to my property. 

After filing an insurance claim, I received a check for {$6900.00} and sent it to Shellpoint Mortgage via certified mail on XX/XX/year>. I was assured by a representative that the check would be processed and returned within XXXX business days. However, weeks passed, and I was informed that the check could not be located. 

Subsequently, I worked with my insurance agent to issue a replacement check. Before mailing the replacement, I contacted Shellpoint to request expedited processing given the prior mishandling, but I was told the same standard XXXX business day timeline would apply. The replacement check was sent via certified mail on XX/XX/year>, and tracking confirmed it was received and signed for by Shellpoint on XX/XX/year>, at XXXX PM. 

Once again, XXXX business days passed with no update. When I followed up on XX/XX/year>, I was told the check could not be located. I requested to speak with a supervisor but was unable to do so at that time. After escalating the matter further, I finally reached a supervisor on XX/XX/year>, who acknowledged that the check had been received but was sitting in a backlog of letters yet to be processed. 

This level of negligence and delay is unacceptable. It has been over XXXX and a half months since I began this process, and my roof remains unrepaired due to Shellpoint 's mishandling of the insurance funds. The funds do not belong to Shellpoint, and holding them for an unreasonable amount of time is both unprofessional and detrimental to your customers. 

I demand immediate action to expedite the processing of my check and a written explanation for the repeated mishandling of this matter. I also request that Shellpoint reviews its procedures for handling insurance claims to ensure that no other customer endures such an ordeal. 

Please address this issue promptly, as any further delay is wholly unacceptable.

They asserted that I owed a delinquent maintenance obligation to XXXX XXXX XXXX. At first, this name did not ring a bell. After further research, I discovered that my late father, who died in XX/XX/XXXX, who has the same name as me ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had purchased a one-week timeshare at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , SC. After he passed away, we set up a trust to manage the affairs of my mother, who moved to Louisiana in XXXX. The trustee attorney, XXXX XXXX of XXXX, Louisiana, handled her legal affairs. XXXX XXXX was not explicitly called out in my fathers probate documents. During the time he owned it, neither he nor my mother ever used it. She did not know that he had purchased a timeshare. 

However, we started receiving notices on whether we wanted to rent out the timeshare, which we responded to affirmatively. However, even after the rental, we received notices that my father owed a maintenance fee of {$100.00} each year, which the trust paid. I was never associated with the property or had it transferred to my name. 

After my mother passed away in XXXX, I asked XXXX XXXX to dispose of the timeshare agreement as part of her probate process. He was not convinced that it had any force, given that it was in my fathers name, and he was deceased. We received no other letters from XXXX XXXX after her probate. XXXX XXXX passed away in XXXX. 

I thought about contacting Pinnacle directly. However, I thought that this might be a scam. I receive many crank phone calls from numbers where I am urged to contact them to Keep my electricity from being turned off, take advantage of a loan offer, or a fake job offer. Although none of these entreaties apply, there is often an element that comes across as truthful. 

In this case, if XXXX had been trying to collect for this long against me, it should have appeared in my credit reports. I ran all three of the major credit agency reports, and nothing came up. When I checked the XXXX XXXX website, it indicated that the facility was closed. 

I will assume that this letter represents a more sophisticated form of letter SCAM and ignore it. However, I thought you might be interested. The scam phone calls on other topics ( often the same message from continuously changing phone numbers ) and emails are increasingly numerous.

I was unaware of this account or any associated charges and was surprised to learn that it was listed as an unpaid obligation on my XXXX report. 

Upon further investigation, I contacted M & T Bank, where a representative informed me that the charge had passed the statute of limitations for collection, and as such, M & T Bank would be removing it from their internal records. However, despite M & T Banks acknowledgment that they will void the charge in their system, the negative entry remains on my XXXX report. 

I am perplexed by this situation, as M & T Bank has confirmed that they will no longer pursue collection of this debt, and the amount in question is no longer collectible due to the statute of limitations. Despite this, XXXX continues to reflect this erroneous charge, which is preventing me from opening an account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

To resolve this matter, I respectfully request that XXXX update my report to reflect the accurate status of this charge, as confirmed by M & T Bank. I am also requesting that XXXX remove this negative entry from my report, as it was reported in error, and my conversation with M & T Bank that supports my claim.

On XX/XX/year>, after having dinner with my family at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, we were walking out of the restaurant and a man approached us in a suit and name tag. He said he worked for XXXX XXXX and asked if I had signed up for my 20 % off coupon. I said I wasnt interested but he was being persistent and said it would only take a few minutes. He led me to the XXXX XXXX XXXX row of ATMs and said I could sign up on the ATM, and I just needed to use my bank card ( in XXXX XXXX many different types of transactions are done through the ATM so this did not seem unusual to me ). 

I inserted my XXXX XXXX  XXXX debit card and logged into the ATM. Another man approached and was trying to distract me. I started to get the sense that something was not right and I tried to retrieve my ATM card but it was stuck in the machine. I took out my citibank credit card and tried to dislodge my ATM card with it but it did not work ( I did not insert it fully into the ATM machine ). The second man walked away and the first man was pretending to assist me. I told him that I worked for the XXXX XXXX and was calling the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to assist he then fled. 

Knowing that my bank card was stuck in the machine, I immediately deactivated it through the app. Subsequently, a number of charges were blocked totaling close to {$7000.00}. Unfortunately, I did not cancel my citibank card because since it didnt go into the ATM machine, I didnt think it was compromised. I only realized it was compromised after I got an alert from Citibank for potential fraud ( charge for {$2500.00} for XXXX XXXX ). Unfortunately, their first transaction of {$1700.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX went through. This does not appear to be a legitimate company and I did not authorize the transaction. I disputed this claim through the fraud department and was told since I was still in possession of the card it was not fraud? Clearly this is a skimming scam and I did not authorize the purchase. Had Citibank performed even a cursory review, they would have realized this was fraud. 

Based on the advice of a very helpful Citibank customer service rep, I then tried to dispute the claim with Citibank as a charge dispute ( instead of fraud which it is ), and then denied the dispute again on XX/XX/year> - stating That once the credit card number is given to merchant and a transaction has taken place, the merchant terms and conditions apply.

11/14/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"If a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt, except ( XXXX ) to advise the consumer that the debt collectors further efforts are being terminated ; ( XXXX ) to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor may invoke specified remedies which are ordinarily invoked by such debt collector or creditor; or ( XXXX ) where applicable, to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor intends to invoke a specified remedy. 
If such notice from the consumer is made by mail, notification shall be complete upon receipt. 
Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), specifically 15 U.S. Code 1692c ( c ), consumers have the right to request that a debt collector ceases further communication regarding a debt. When a consumer sends a written request or informs the collector that they refuse to pay, the collector is legally obligated to stop contacting the consumer, with only a few exceptions. Heres a breakdown of what this provision entails and how it might impact your credit profile : XXXX. Purpose of XXXX ( c ) : This section allows consumers to regain control over communications from debt collectors. Once a collector receives a written cease communication request or a clear statement of refusal to pay, they must comply by stopping most forms of contact. 
XXXX. Exceptions to the Rule : After a XXXX ( c ) request, a collector can still contact the consumer to : Inform them that collection efforts will cease. 
Notify them of any specific legal actions the collector or creditor intends to take. 
Confirm or provide additional information regarding the debt. 
XXXX. How XXXX ( c ) Impacts Credit Reporting : Requesting a cessation of communication does not directly remove a debt from your credit report. It stops communication but does not erase the debt or affect its validity. However, if a debt collector violates this provision, you may have grounds to dispute the debt if it continues to appear on your report or if communication persists in violation of the law. 
XXXX. Challenging Debt Legitimacy : Although XXXX ( c ) does not remove a debt from a credit profile, you can dispute inaccurate or outdated debt entries separately under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). If successful, such a dispute can lead to the debt being corrected or removed. 
XXXX. Steps if Debt Remains on Credit Profile After Request : You may need to submit disputes to the credit reporting agencies, providing any evidence of the written XXXX ( c ) request. This can bolster your case for removal if the debt remains inaccurately listed as unresolved or active in collections. 
This section ensures peace from collection calls but doesnt erase the record of debt ; however, it provides leverage if the collector violates these rules.

I intentionally keep minimal funds in my checking account, opting instead to maintain higher balances in savings to earn interest.

This was also the date of my last lease payment. I was exploring whether to buy out my lease or have a dealer lease buyout. Every time I would contact US Bank Leasing, the buyout amount would be different. Even times where the I'd talk to two different representatives on the same day ; the buyout amount would be different. After multiple phone calls and a lot of mixed results, I decided it would be easiest to just deal with a dealership buyout, even though this was costing me extra money ( US Bank Leasing likes to charge dealerships more than they do the consumer ). 

In order to move this process along faster, I paid off my lease on XX/XX/XXXX. However, as I later found out, US Bank Leasing would not apply my early payment until the XXXX and if I terminated before the XXXX, I would be charged an 'Early Termination Fee '. I then decided to wait to turn in my dealership buy out on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX They provided me with a lease buy out quote and applied this to my deal on a new vehicle. Upon signing documents, I then learned that the lease buy out through the dealership did not include sales tax, whereas my own personal buyout would include this amount. This would be another {$1500.00} lost. Since the deal was all but done, I decided to sign the deal and be done with US Bank Leasing. However, apparently this was still far too simple.

US Bank Leasing decided to remove another payment, that was not owed from my checking account for {$610.00}. I called them about getting this overpayment refunded, to which they told me they would submit a request for a cashier 's check be sent to me. This could take up to 7-10 business days to receive. After waiting 10+ business days, I called to check on the status of my refund check, to which I found out that they reversed the refund check because it was needed to satisfy my lease buy out. The lease buyout number they provided to the dealership INCLUDED my own personal overpayment so they would now need to use that money to satisfy my lease buy out. Essentially, allowing the dealership access to the refund on my account. No contact attempt was made on US Banks behalf to find out if this was acceptable, this refund amount was not provided to my dealership, US Bank Leasing just took it upon themselves to quote the dealership a lower buyout amount using my money.

After talking with three different representatives today, XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX I'm told this is something that happens frequently. They just give their costumer 's money to dealerships and hose their customers. I asked them why a simple policy change to NEVER provide dealership a customer 's credit/refund would be so hard, to which I received no response. Now, I am left receiving no vehicle sales tax credit, paying US Bank Leasing more for my trade in, and they took it upon themselves to take my refund of {$610.00} and provide it to the dealership I traded my truck into.

11/15/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Credit inquiries on your report that you don't recognize,"On XX/XX/2024, at approx. XXXX XXXX, a door-to-door salesman knocked on my front door selling XXXX XXXX XXXX. She provided no credentials that she actually worked for XXXX, nor that she was allowed to solicit door-to-door. After listening to the pitch for 5 minutes, the salesman ( XXXX XXXX ) let herself into the house without asking permission. At the time I was busy preparing to pick up my XXXX  child from school and take care of my XXXX child. My wife was, at the time, in XXXX on a XXXX trip. I thought it was inappropriate that the salesman let herself into my house, but I did not tell her to leave, as home security was something I had genuinely been thinking of. 

I had a XXXX doorbell at my front door, but I am not subscribed to have the feed stored. Thinking back, the salesman may have entered my house so that our conversation could not have been recorded. Once inside, the salesman continued her pitch. I repeatedly told her it would not be in the budget and that we could not afford the product. She then offered an extended, risk-free trial period on the product and services that would last 30 days. I asked what the cost would be of the product and services for the 30 days and she responded it would be just under {$1.00}. I then asked if, by agreeing to this extended trial period I would have any issues with any standard trial periods and she told me there would be no issues. I agreed to have the installation occur on the basis that we would have a 30 day, risk-free trial period. She said she would need a debit card to put on my account to pay the {$1.00} for the installation. I gave her the card number. 

She told me she would need to begin the account creation process and asked to take my picture with her XXXX. She said this was a part of the account creation process. Afterward she asked for my SSN which she also said was part of the account creation process. It was quickly becoming time for me to leave my house to pick up my child from school. She asked if she could join us and I agreed. In the car she asked if she could use my phone to complete the account creation process. I told her that would be fine as long as it was solely to finish creating an account. She took my phone and did, what I assumed, was what needed to happen to finish the account creation. She asked what my email address, phone number and street address were. Beyond this I was asked no more questions regarding account creation. 

When we arrived back home after I had picked up my child from school, she told me they would send somebody quickly to perform the security system installation. She told me the total cost of the installation and equipment would be approx {$3500.00}. I asked if there was anything I needed to sign before the installation had taken place and she told me I would only need to sign once the installer had arrived. I also asked XXXX who I should reach out to if I have any concerns or questions. She told me she would be my point-of-contact with XXXX and would answer any questions or concerns I had going forward. She gave me her phone number. I thanked her for her time and she left my house. 

Later that evening, an installer from XXXX arrived and performed the installation of all equipment in the XXXX XXXX XXXX which includes : XXXX external cameras ( over garage and in backyard ), smart thermostat, front door lock, smoke and CO monitor, door sensors, four window stickers, smart garage door opener, doorbell camera, and a yard sign. After the installation was completed, I was asked to sign the Schedule of Equipment and Services document, which I was told was just a verification that all products were installed at the time of the scheduled installation. I signed this document on the installers XXXX. The installer left my residence. 

After discussing the security system with my wife, we agreed that we no longer wanted it and would request an uninstall. On Monday, XX/XX/year> ( 12 days after the installation ) I tried sending a text message to XXXX asking to schedule an uninstall. When I received no response, I tried calling, which also got me no response. I then decided I would schedule the uninstall thru XXXX customer support. 

I called XXXX customer support and a rep answered and ultimately told me I could not cancel the contract unless I paid the total value of the products. I was told that their documentation on file said I had signed an agreement to a 3-day trial period. I had never signed this, nor been asked to sign this by the sales representative, nor any other XXXX representative. While speaking with the phone rep, I looked for an email of the documents that had my forged signatures. I saw an email from the same date as the installation with my forged signatures on the SYSTEM EQUIPMENT PURCHASE AND SERVICES AGREEMENT, XXXX CONSENT, and NOTICE OF CANCELLATION. I was never told that an email with any documents would be coming to me during my conversation with the door-to-door salesman, so I didnt think to check that email for anything at the time. Most importantly, I was never asked to sign these documents, nor was I asked if I verbally agreed to anything outlined in them. I asked to be put in contact with a manager or supervisor and my call was transferred to XXXX ( unsure of spelling ). XXXX reiterated that I would not be able to cancel the contract even though I had not signed the documents. I asked if XXXX had been in contact with the door-to-door salesman XXXX and they said they had not. I asked if they would try then and there. XXXX put me on hold for several minutes and came back to say he tried but that she did not answer. The call dropped abruptly and when I tried to call back they couldnt hear my voice. XXXX sent me an email recapping what we had talked about. 

After that call, I sent a hard copy of my intent to cancel, explaining how I should not have to pay for this equipment because : 1 ) I was within the 30-day trial period promised by the sales representative, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and 2 ) I did not sign the contract documents ; they were fraudulently signed by someone other than myself agreeing to terms and conditions that I did not agree with. The letter was delivered on XX/XX/year>. The only correspondence I have seen from XXXX since my phone call on XX/XX/XXXX, has been a form email, received on XX/XX/XXXX, reiterating that I do not qualify for cancellation of the contract. 

Around this same time, I received a credit card in the mail issued by Fortiva Bank. I didn't recognize the bank and did some more research and found that XXXX had opened an account and a line of credit in my name without my authorization. I also saw that my credit score had dropped XXXX points. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fortiva Bank to open a dispute for the account being fraudulently opened in my name. I sent in pertinent documents, but have not heard about a resolution from them. I did receive confirmation that the dispute had been started.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Atlanticus Services Corporation,TX,75165,None,Consent provided,Web,11/15/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10812802

The terms were that if the flights were canceled within XXXX hours they were fully refundable. Our plans changed, so I canceled the flights within the XXXX hour time period and received an email from XXXX ( attached ) on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the full amount of {$1900.00} would be refunded to my credit card. 

Over XXXX weeks passed and only {$320.00} had been credited to my account. First, I called XXXX XXXX, but they said XXXX had to tell them the amount that needed to be refunded, as I did not book the flights with XXXX directly but through XXXX, so there was nothing they could do unless they hard from XXXX. I called XXXX and they acknowledged that I canceled the flights within the XXXX hour time period and was entitled to the full refund of {$1900.00}. They said it could take up to XXXX months for the full amount to be refunded. They also said that it was possible the credit card company already had the funds but were withholding them. 

I called the credit card company, FNBO ( an XXXX credit card ) and they said XXXX had only sent the {$320.00}, so on XX/XX/XXXX I filed a dispute. There was some confusion, as the charges were listed on my credit card as XXXX separate charges of {$650.00} ( as opposed to the total amount paid of {$1900.00} stated in the XXXX email as the refund amount ). I was told I needed to file three separate disputes for each charge separately -- that is, three different disputes in the amount of {$650.00} each, but one of those had to take into account the difference between the amount already refunded ( {$320.00} ) and the remainder owed, which was {$330.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the first {$650.00} was credited to my account. On XXXX XXXX, the remaining {$330.00} was credited to my account for the second charge. However, on XXXX XXXX the final refund amount of {$650.00} was credited on to my account, but then reversed by FNBO and recharged to my account again for the final {$650.00}. 

I called the FNBO dispute department and they said XXXX 's policy was that flights were non-refundable. I explained that all three flights were booked at the same time and canceled at the same time ( within the XXXX hour time frame ), so why would XXXX flights be refundable and not the third? I sent FNBO disputes the email from XXXX that stated the full amount should be refunded ( {$1900.00} ) and explained the situation again as a new dispute, but FNBO said my cases were closed and there was nothing more they could do for me. 

So, they insisted I would NOT receive a refund for the final {$650.00}, and this amount remained on my card. I paid it off because I didn't want to pay interest on money I didn't actually owe and I waited, hoping XXXX would send the full refund to FNBO, they would see their mistake, and finally refund the full amount.

11/21/2024,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I have two loans with two different banks, XXXX XXXX  and BMO, both for recreational vehicles. Each loan is a fixed rate loan charged a daily interest rate. My monthly payments for each are distributed between principle and interest each month and I am completely aware that interest will be higher than the principle contributions. My issue is specifically on how they apply payments made in excess of what is owed as the minimum payment. Example ; fixed rate loan is 7.49 % with a monthly payment of {$560.00}. With exception of maybe 1 or 2 months, each month I have made payments in excess of that minimum amount. The idea was to have those applied to principle however that is not how they are applying payments. They are taking the excess monies and applying it to interest charges and then reducing the minimum payment amount for the following month by the overage amount that was applied to the interest charge. They are not applying this to principle. This practice seems incredibly unfair. They are taking my money which would allow for me to reduce the principle balance and instead applying to what I would XXXX future interest owned. They are applying it to their own interest income and changing me interest on a higher principle balance that I paid extra to reduce. After speaking to both companies, I was told that I have to actually go online, call, mail in or go into a branch to be sure that my additional payments are being allocated to principle. In fact, the BMO representative read me their internal policy or talking points and it said, excess payments were to be applied to principle but he assured me that that does not happen. If I am making my required minimum payment and then additional funds are received at the exact same time, why are they not applying those funds to benefit the consumer vs. themselves. This feels like a very unfair practice and almost deceptive. In order for clients to understand that what they intended to be principle contributions are not actually being applied, they would have to review their statements AND call the bank to understand why their payments are reflecting either a lower or no payment amount. I was told by the representative that even if I requested a reallocation of funds to be applied to principle vs. interest that in his experience, these are denied. He said it would be unsuccessful but did offer to submit it. This does not seem like a process that benefits the consumer at all and lines the pockets of the bank instead.

I spoke with XXXX XXXX, bank manager. I explained that the interest payments on my M & T Premier Savings account were below the Premier Savings Rate of XXXX XXXX as promised, when I first opened the Savings Account. I stated that I had contacted the bank or came into the bank to make sure that I was receiving the promotional rate, the bank tellers would tell me that I was all set. Previously I would call M & T on their XXXX telephone number and would be told that I am receiving the promotional rate. At XXXX XXXX  I called XXXX # XXXX at the M & T XXXX number and she looked into the matter for me. Specifically why I was only receiving XXXX XXXX on my Premier Savings account, that advertised a higher rate of XXXX XXXX  for XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. Especially since my balance was higher, due to a {$50000.00} deposit I just made on XX/XX/year> of which an interest rate of 4.08 % was quoted to me as my M & T Premier Savings account rate. 
The correction I want, is for the interest payments to reflect the Premier Savings rate of interest I signed up for when I was influenced at the time, that this was the best liquid account I could sign up for from M & T bank. 
At this point neither the M & T branch manager XXXX XXXX nor XXXX # XXXX at the M & T home office could help me resolve this issue. The branch manager XXXX XXXX called me on XX/XX/year> at XXXX XXXX  and did agree to fix the issue after some research could be done on his end. XXXX XXXX ended the conversation with a promise to contact me on whether he could give me the Premier Savings account rate for the dates in which I did not receive the Premier Savings account rate. Hopefully this issue can be resolved, as again today, I asked the M & T Branch Manager XXXX XXXX, if he had any disclosures or policy pamphlets that would reflect the banks policy regarding their Premier Savings account requirements, he did not reply.

In support of XXXX ) a ) I sent you a copy of the payment instruction clearly showing XXXX XXXX on the lhs b ) you can effortlessly check all the incoming payments into the account of your client XXXX XXXX where you will see my payments I expect you to use your common sense and not have me spoon feed you. 

In support of XXXX ) asking XXXX to verify their recalls is of much lower priority now because : a ) As soon as I suspected a fraud I contacted your call centre ( without making further contact with the fraudster ) who asked me to forward all the fraudulent emails to your Citibank in XXXX. They then contacted you so you were fully aware of the circumstances and the website, email addresses and telephone numbers were taken down immediately. 
b ) I also contacted your CEO XXXX XXXX by letter and email so you were fully appraised of the circumstances and should have returned my money without my asking again and again and having to contact the CFPB. 
As I said before I expect you to use your common sense and initiative. 

In the interests of transparency I want Citibank NA to share with me : XXXX ) their communications with Citibank XXXX XXXX ) all the transactions on the fraudulent account. 

effectively Citibank participated in the fraud and facilitated money laundering Of course there will not be any money left now in the criminal account as Citibank will have closed it but there would have been plenty there when when I contacted them and they should refund it plus 10 % pa interest compounded. 

Citibank are pretending not to know about the the transactions and they are not co-operating with XXXX who have advised that the correct procedure is to contact XXXX via XXXX and they will then be put in touch with the correct team to trace the payments. 

From XXXX : If any further technical data or information is required by Citibank as part of their investigations, they must contact us via the established XXXX channel, using the XXXX network, to ensure the correct area of our business is approached ; it is not for you to attempt to do this for them. 


Please ask Citibank NA to refund my money as I wrote to their CEO XXXX XXXX way back in XX/XX/XXXX. 
They are only concerned with protecting their own interests and not that of victims of fraud. 
As fraud is now on an industrial scale, everyone should be helping everyone else, regardless of whether they are a customer or not. Citibank XXXX told me they could not help me as I am not a customer! 

Yours sincerely XXXX XXXX Conclusions I hope the XXXX will note the convincing nature of the fake brochure and the fact that it requires payment into a Citibank account. 
Had Citibank not taken this criminal as a customer, I would not have paid by any other means except to a Citibank account as it was meant to be a Citibank investment. 
I hope that the XXXX will see me as a victim of this criminal customer of Citibank and ask Citibank to refund all of my GBP XXXX plus 10 % interest pa compounded. 
Based on the evidence submitted above, it is clear that Citibank XXXX have been nothing but arrogant, obstructive and bullying, not just towards me but towards XXXX as well. 


Citibank are clearly at fault for taking on this customer whose sole purpose was to defraud the public What I now expect from Citibank US Citibank have been nothing but obstructive and bullying over the last 4 years. For this reason alone, they should refund all my money plus 10 % interest pa compounded Citibank deny receiving my money into their client account in spite of my providing all the transfer details and for this reason alone, they should refund all my money plus 10 % interest pa compounded. 
Citibank UK as well as Citibank US were informed of this fraudulent transaction and all the fake emails and telephone numbers were taken down rapidly so it is pointless on their part to deny any knowledge of their criminal customer.. For this reason alone, they should refund all my money plus 10 % interest pa compounded. 
Citibank US have refused to co - operate with XXXX via XXXX to trace my money which they deny receiving as well as the 9 recall notices sent by XXXX. For this reason alone, they should refund all my money plus 10 % interest pa compounded I demand to see all the communications between Citibank US and Citibank UK I demand to see all the transactions in the criminal account with Citibank I expect a further fine to be imposed on Citibank US for their continued delinquent behaviour in spite of previous warnings and pleas Attachments letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX fake Citibank brochure complete with Citi logos and text confirmation from XXXX about XXXX transfer confirmation from XXXX about XXXX transfer I have various emails to Citibank UK as well as Citibank US which I can not attach but can forward Download all attachments as a zip file CEO Citibank US - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX page XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX page XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX pqge XXXX XXXX XXXX Fake Citibank brochure .pdf XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",None,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/11/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10759846

11/8/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"US Bank continues to operate poorly. Today I found my accounts frozen due to suspected activity. When I called, it took me over an hour to finally reach the department that "" closed the account ''. 
1. Every person on the phone ( 3-4 ) proclaimed "" we have no way of reaching XXXX and don't have a number to connect you to ''. UNACCEPTABLE - They lock my business accounts with over $ XXXX tied up and proclaim it could be up to 24 hrs before someone will call me to discuss. 

2. Only through persistence and demanding a supervisor, on the 3rd supervisor, they miraculously found a number to talk with XXXX dept. 

3. Once finally connected, over an hour into the call, XXXX from XXXX gets on call. During the course of the call, he asked me a series of questions regarding the suspicious activity which I confirm I authorized. He then proclaims because I shared my account info, it was FRAUD and the account would remain closed and I'd have to go to a branch and open a new account. This is ridiculous! I authorized the logins and verified the company and their eventual deposit into my account which was the reason for the account validation. I have 2 factor authentication on my account and would know if this vendor ever tried to use those logins again folowing our call. 

4. Throughout the process, representatives on the phone repeatedly stated Company policiy and procedure '' dictates the account being closed. There was NO FRAUDULENT Activity on the Account. I validated the user was on the phone with me and was authorized. XXXX the XXXX XXXX refused to understand the circumstances and the impact of locking my business accounts before a long weekend. 

XXXX. XXXX with XXXX DENIED me the right to discuss with his supervisor and hung up on me because I challenged his decision and asked for other options before shutting down my small business for the next 4-5 days ( I'm out of state without access to a USBank ) and Monday is a holiday all because he's seen these transactions tied to fraud previously. He refused to accept my authorization for the logins and provide options. 

6. US Bank fraud department and handling of small business accounts need to be investigated by the CFPB. This is ridiculous. They have now tied up almost {$75000.00} in my funds over the last 10 days due to the mishandling of 3 transctions. 10 Days ago they processed the same ACH 3x and refused to take responsibility while tying up @ XXXX until on day 5 they admitted their mistake and miraculously were able to credit my account despite for 4 days claiming "" there was no way '' to credit the account for this blatant mistake. Next, I reported a fraudulent check that was cashed on my account 7 days ago tying up yet another {$9500.00} while they process the claim. The check has XXXX US bank markings on it and is blatantly fraud. And now, when the activity is authorized, they senselessly freeze my accounts and force me to go without access to my $ XXXX for upwards of the next 5 days. 

This is causing incredible undue hardship on a veteran owned, small business. Additionally, the lack of appropriate response by any of the multitude of folks on the phone is truly UNACCEPTABLE. No one listens, no one tries to resolve, instead they dismiss my concerns and need for solutions and attempt to stand behind a policy. Just like the 3 ACHs they erroneously processed, there was absolutely a solution to credit my account real time. Just like there is a way to credit my account for the fraudulent check and just like there is a way to unfreeze my account when I clearly stated I authorized the user to access my account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,CO,80907,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/8/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10731521

11/15/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"Approx. 2 weeks ago, I filed a claim with this organization asserting that Wells Fargo is manipulating charges to charge consumers overdraft fees. Since then, Wells Fargo has claimed this is untrue by sending me a copy of the fee schedule and its terms and conditions. With this being said, the fee schedule is as follows : 1st ) Holds 2nd ) Deposits : Pending deposits that are immediately available. 
3rd ) Withdrawals That said, on XX/XX/year>, I received a 24-hour grace period notice. In this message, I had until XXXX XXXX. EST to bring my account to a positive status, or I would incur an overdraft fee. The transactions are as follows : 1 ) At XXXX XXXX., I owed the bank a balance of - {$170.00}, which did not include an overdraft fee. 
2 ) At XXXXXXXX XXXX., I owed the bank a balance of - {$170.00}. Again, this did not include an overdraft fee. 
3 ) At XXXXXXXX XXXX, I deposited {$190.00} in the bank, bringing the balance to a positive status of {$20.00}. This did not have an overdraft fee. 
4 ) At XXXXXXXX XXXX, my new balance was now XXXX. This included the overdraft fee. 

According to Wells Fargo, the overdraft fee should have been included in the XXXXXXXX XXXX. balance and added to it at XXXXXXXX XXXX. EST. Therefore, when I made my deposit, I should have made a deposit that included the overdraft fee. However, as you can see from the above actions and pictures of my account, this is untrue. I was positive, and the bank still assessed me an overdraft fee. Please remember that transactions from XXXX are available for immediate use, so how can I be in positive status and still be assessed an overdraft fee? Especially since, according to Wells Fargo 's letter, the Deposits are the second process in the balance calculation formula. Suppose Wells Fargo, or any bank, can assess an overdraft fee after the account is brought to positive status. In that case, the deadline they attempt to impose doesn't mean anything because I could have met the deadline and still be charged an overdraft. Wells Fargo sent their letter to you and me stating, "" On XXXX XXXX, a recurring payment of {$56.00} was debited from my account, leaving me a balance of $ XXXX ( paid ). On XXXX XXXX, a recurring {$49.00} from XXXX was authorized, and I had an ending balance of - {$67.00} ( paid ). On XXXX XXXX, I received incoming transfer credit for {$98.00} from XXXX, thus creating a balance of {$130.00}, leaving me a - {$38.00}. The problem is that the actual balance at the time of the transfer was {$67.00}, and the {$98.00} covered that, leaving me in the positive with the remaining funds. The bank waited approximately one hour after the XXXX transfer to post the overdraft... the same thing they did today. This means that Wells Fargo changed the order of the transactions and/or renamed the XXXX type from recurring to incoming transfer. They also stated in their response, "" Deposits made after XXXX EST will not increase the accounts available balance in time to avoid the overdraft fee. '' This is not part of the terms and services agreement, especially given that the cutoff time is based on the location of the deposit or transfer ( page 9 ). This goes to my point of using two different time zones. With this, here is the exact process according to page 9 of the terms : Step 1 ) We calculate the available balance in your account that can be used to pay your transactions. Step 2 ) We sort your transactions into categories : 2A ) Credit deposits, 2B ) Subtract withdrawals, and 3C ) Paychecks and reauthorized ACH payments. Step 3 ) If the available balance is not enough the use of overdraft fees become applicable. With all this being said, the 24-hour grace period is EST standard, but the definition of cutoff time is "" local time, '' i.e., MST. The time line presented to me goes on to say "" We credit deposit received before the cutoff time ... '' Which does appear in both the app and website. From that credit they subtract the transactions ( which is done ). If there isn't enough to cover all transactions the overdraft fee is assessed ( this doesn't happen ). As you can see from the screenshots... the first step was done minus the overdraft fee being included. The second step was done ... and the third step was done but the account was already in the positives thus the overdraft fee should not have occurred.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CO,80011,None,Consent provided,Web,11/15/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10817615
11/6/2024,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Complaint Against Freedom Mortgage for Unauthorized Escrow Refund Use and Failure to Issue Refund Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am filing a formal complaint regarding Freedom Mortgage, as they have misappropriated my escrow refund without authorization, causing significant inconvenience and frustration. 

Recently, Freedom Mortgage took funds from my escrow refund, stating they used these funds to pay my school taxes. However, I had already paid my taxes directly and I don't not pay school taxes because I have no kids, also did not authorize Freedom Mortgage to make this payment. Upon realizing the mistake, I contacted Freedom Mortgage, and they assured me a refund check would be sent promptly. However, despite multiple follow-ups, they have delayed returning my money and have provided inconsistent responses, leaving me feeling like I am being given the runaround. 

This situation has caused considerable financial strain, and I believe Freedom Mortgage has acted improperly by using my escrow funds without authorization and by failing to promptly resolve the issue once it was identified. I am seeking assistance from the CFPB to expedite the return of my escrow refund and ensure that Freedom Mortgage takes appropriate steps to prevent this issue from happening again.

11/17/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"My mortgage is held by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Illinois, but is serviced by LoanCare of XXXX  XXXX, VA. I scheduled a payment through the mortgage servicing company 's online portal for {$2400.00} to buy paid on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I cancelled that payment online and received an email confirming that the payment was cancelled. Believing that payment was cancelled, I scheduled a new one for XX/XX/XXXX for {$1200.00}. I had a change in circumstance and cancelled that payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, I received an email confirming that my payment was cancelled. On XX/XX/XXXX, the {$1200.00} was withdrawn from my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$2400.00} was withdrawn from my account. Now, my account is overdrawn. I still have a payment scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX for {$1200.00} that I also cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX. They are telling me that payment will be processed also. 

I reached out to the company on XX/XX/XXXX to have the funds returned to me since they are needed to pay other bills. At that time I was told that online payments have to be cancelled 3 full business days before their scheduled payment date or they will be processed despite the confirmed cancellation. I asked where this information was available to the public and was told that it is internal information that is not shared with the consumer. This is clearly a deceptive practice meant to materially harm the consumer and mislead them about the ability to cancel a payment. 

Their policy is that I must show them proof that the funds were withdrawn from my account ( even though they know they have the funds ). Once I provide the proof, then they will take 5 business days to process my request. At the time, they will mail me a check for the funds that they illegally withdrew from my account. This is a stalling tactic that again is intended to materially harm the consumer and deprive them access to their own assets.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",IL,60048,None,Consent provided,Web,11/17/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10831414

11/6/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Newrez, acting as a mortgage service company, erroneously placed Lender Placed Insurance ( LPI ) on my home mortgage loan, and in so doing attempted to force me to pay an additional {$340.00} monthly fee to cover the cost of the escrow they established to pay for the LPI. 

During my previous complaint against this company regarding this issue, they made numerous false statements, specifically producing letters they alleged were written and mailed to my XXXX XXXX insurance agent and myself, forewarning us of their intent to implement LPI. However none of these letters were ever received by my agent or myself. 

They continued their response to my CFPB complaint by saying they did not receive proof of insurance until XX/XX/year>, which was the excuse that was used to establish the LPI to begin with. After reading their response, I contacted the Newrez Insurance Compliance Department on XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with an insurance representative on a recorded line ( see document attached ) that stated that Newrez received proof of insurance for this loan on ; XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/year>. He also confirmed that the earlier proof of insurance that was mailed to the Newrez Texas address instead of the Michigan location, had also been received. So with this information, it became clear that Newrez had no reason to ever place LPI. 

Now as I continue to make my regular monthly payment in full and on time, Newrez shifted from charging me a monthly LPI escrow fee, to now applying late fees every single month. This is a result of my not paying their inflated monthly payment to cover the LPI escrow, which again should never have been created. So they are basically attempting to penalize me for not paying their inaccurate statement amounts. 

To compound the damages they have already caused by making me expend dozens of hours writing letters and filing complaints, they are now reporting false information to all three Credit Reporting Agencies by showing an inflated Past Due making it appear as if I am over 30 days delinquent even though they continue to cash my checks every month.

11/10/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Subject : Privacy Act Violations, Inaccurate Reporting, Predatory Lending, and Misrepresentation by Credit Acceptance Corporation and XXXX XXXX XXXX  Complaint Summary : I am filing this complaint against Credit Acceptance Corporation and XXXX XXXX XXXX  for multiple violations of my consumer rights. These include misrepresentation of contract terms, predatory lending, unfair and deceptive practices, and ongoing unauthorized reporting to credit bureaus despite a paid-off balance on the equitable side. The issues in question involve inflated pricing, undisclosed liens, and an incomplete vehicle history, among other serious concerns : 1. Violation of Privacy Rights and Ignoring Opt-Out Request : Under the Privacy Act, as a federally protected consumer, I formally opted out of all authorized disclosures under PART 1016 - Privacy of Consumer Financial Information ( Regulation P ). Despite my request, Credit Acceptance Corporation has disregarded my opt-out directive by continuing to report transaction history to credit bureaus without my consent, violating 12 CFR 1016.1. Credit Acceptance Corporation failed to provide an initial privacy notice per 12 CFR 1016.4, denying me the opportunity to prevent unauthorized disclosures. They have also violated
my rights under 12 USC 531 by failing to honor my opt-out notice or provide a clear method to prevent disclosure.

2. Misrepresentation of Contract Terms and Security Interest : Credit Acceptance Corporation has misrepresented the nature of the contract associated with this account. They claimed a security interest in the vehicle without filing a UCC-1 financing statement or establishing a lien to verify their interest. My search of the UCC records revealed no lien on the vehicle, indicating their security interest is unfounded.

I also provided full payment for the vehicle, effectively relinquishing any supposed security interest. This action directly contravenes Indiana Code Title 26, Article 1, Chapter 3.1, Section 602, which governs the correct handling of such Under Indiana UCC Sections 26-1-3.1-602 and 26-1-3.1-603, a party tendering payment on an instrument has the right to expect that : The account will be credited in full, or If dishonored, the negotiable instrument must be returned to the obligor in its original form. Credit Acceptances failure to meet either of these requirements has caused undue harm by retaining my receivables without crediting my account, in clear violation of these statutory provisions. Additionally, per CFR 433.2 and CFR 444.3, Credit Acceptances handling of this matter raises concerns under federal consumer protection laws concerning unfair or deceptive practices. Specifically, the improper processing of my payment as a check
rather than as a negotiable instrument which now results into a billing error 15 usc 1666b. Credit Acceptance Corporation continues to inaccurately report the account status to credit bureaus, violating the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) under 15 USC 1681 by failing to accurately report account status and security interests. 
XXXX. Predatory Lending and Inflated Pricing : The original bill of sale reveals that XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX sold this vehicle to me at an inflated price of approximately {$18000.00}, while the market value was closer to {$11000.00}. The vehicle also had accident history and prior liens that were not disclosed at the time of sale, further reducing its value. 
This excessive pricing, combined with undisclosed defects and liens, constitutes predatory lending practices and a potential violation of TILA. Both Credit Acceptance Corporation and XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to disclose key information that would have impacted my purchase decision, including the true market value of the vehicle and its complete history.

4. Fraud and Misrepresentation by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  misrepresented the vehicles value and history, concealing information on prior accidents and liens that affect its resale value and my ownership rights. This failure to disclose critical details constitutes fraud and violates state and federal laws on fair market disclosure. Additionally, my down payment was not fully credited toward the vehicle purchase, raising further questions about their accounting practices and compliance with consumer protection laws.

5. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Obligations Under TILA and 15 USC 6802 : Under 15 USC 6802, Credit Acceptance Corporation has an obligation to respect my privacy rights and to provide an opt-out notice before disclosing personal information. They failed to notify me of my rights and continue to report inaccurately to the credit bureaus, violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by misrepresenting my account status. 
Furthermore, they reported a late payment despite the fact that the account was fully paid on the equitable side. Given the lack of a valid security interest or lien, they lack grounds for this reporting, thereby infringing on my rights under both FCRA and TILA.

6. Organized Crime and Racketeering Concerns ( RICO ) : The pattern of conduct by both Credit Acceptance Corporation and XXXX XXXX XXXX, including inflated prices, hidden terms, fraudulent reporting, and disregard for consumer privacy, suggests a potential RICO ( Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ) violation. This pattern of unfair and deceptive practices potentially points to an organized effort to defraud consumers through a combination of misrepresentation, overcharging, and unauthorized disclosures.

Requested Resolution : I request that the CFPB investigate Credit Acceptance Corporation and XXXX XXXX XXXX for : Failing to respect my opt-out rights and violating Privacy Act regulations by continuing to disclose my transaction history to credit bureaus. 
Violating TILA by misrepresenting the total cost of financing, inflating the vehicles price well above its market value, and not disclosing the vehicles accident history and prior liens. 
Engaging in predatory lending practices and failing to provide an accurate, complete account history. 
Reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus, including late payments and an improper security interest claim, in violation of FCRA requirements.

Possible racketeering practices under RICO by exhibiting a repeated pattern of fraudulent activity, misleading disclosures, and unfair treatment of consumers. 

I request that this account be removed from my credit report, or alternatively, corrected to reflect the accurate status of paid in full with no security interest. I also request that Credit Acceptance Corporation honor my opt-out directive and cease all unauthorized disclosures of my personal information.

My daughter has a XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX child and is pregnant with my granddaughter and their existing AC while only four years old, was not cooling the house properly. The cost was {$15000.00}. XXXX XXXXXXXX installed the AC unit but said they could not install the new duct work. Since I had paid them to install both and they were NOT priced separately, I filed a dispute with Citi Bank until the matter could be resolved with XXXX XXXX as to how much money I would be refunded for the work NOT done. The XXXX XXXX also did not cool the house properly. Citi Bank initially reversed the {$15000.00} charge on my Citi Costco Visa card but unilaterly decided to close the dispute and place the {$15000.00} charge on my Citi Costco Visa card. This was despite the fact that I had provided them copies of all the documents they requested multiple times. Further, Citi demanded minimum payments in excess of XXXX. To add insult to injury, they damaged my XXXX credit rating and charged me interest on work that was NOT completed. 

After months of negotiating with XXXX XXXX, they agreed to credit me {$11000.00} for the duct work they were unable to do. Since Citi Bank Visa forced to make payments on the charge that I had rightfully disputed, I ended up having a credit of {$2200.00}.

This call was in regard to my XXXX XXXX account. 

On XX/XX/year>, a representative from Radius Global Solutions contacted my mother directly on her phone, stating that the call was in relation to benefits concerning myself. My mother, believing it was legitimate and related to my well-being, merged the call with me. During this call, the representative requested that I verify my Social Security number, leading to the inadvertent disclosure of personal information with my mother present.

According to the FDCPA, debt collectors are prohibited from discussing details of a consumers debt or related personal information with third parties without explicit consent. Furthermore, they may only contact third parties to obtain location information, and they must avoid misrepresenting the nature of their call. The representatives misleading statement about benefits and the request for sensitive information in the presence of my mother is a direct violation of these guidelines and has caused me distress and concern.

I respectfully request that your office investigate this incident to determine if appropriate enforcement actions can be taken against Radius Global Solutions. Additionally, I would appreciate guidance on any further actions I should take to address this violation and ensure my privacy rights are respected. 

Please feel free to reach me at XXXX or via email should you require further information or documentation regarding this complaint.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was the company who installed our panels while Regions, formally known as Enerbank USA, financed the transaction. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX had explained to us that our monthly bill for the system would be $ XXXX at a 1.49 % interest rate. While filling out our application for the panels we also informed them that we only made $ XXXX. Their coach informed them to instead write that we made $ XXXX even after reiterating 3 times that, that was not the case. XXXX also explained to us that we didn't have to pay for the system for the XXXX year if we chose to and would also qualify for a tax credit to help us pay off the panels sooner. My husband and I decided to start paying on our XXXX year of having our panels and while doing our taxes we soon discovered that we were not eligible for the tax credit, and have since been paying a monthly charge of {$250.00} instead of the $ XXXX while our rate went up to 1.99 %. In the recent time of having panels we also experienced our local electric company giving us astronomically higher bills than we have ever paid before and continue to do so. We were told we would see lower bills, instead we are paying higher bills and a high monthly charge for our solar panel system. My wife and I sought legal advice through an attorney provided by XXXX XXXX. After reviewing the contract given to us by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a year after purchasing the panels, our Texas attorney wrote a letter on our behalf stating the multiple Texas Business codes broken in this transaction. 

Furthermore, this entering of a XXXX XXXX and Install Agreement occurred at our home. Texas Business and Commerce Code Chapter 601 applies to the Agreement as a transaction between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, being the installer and merchant, and my husband and I as the consumer, where their agent engaged in a personal solicitation of a sale to consumer at a place other than your place of business or the agreement to purchase is given by the consumer at a place other than their place of business. 

Section 601.052 requires XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to provide us with a complete copy of a contract pertaining to the transaction, and such contract must contain, in immediate proximity to the space reserved in the contract for the signature of the consumer, in boldface type of a minimum size of XXXX points a notice that we may cancel the contract at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of the transaction. The Agreement was not delivered to us at the time of the transaction and did not provide such notice. 

Section 601.053 requires in part that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX as merchant attach to the agreement a completed notice of cancellation form in duplicate that contains certain information in XXXX boldface type described in such statute. No such notice of cancellation form was attached to the Agreement.

Section 601.201 provides that a sale or contract entered into in violation of Section 601.053 ( b ) is void. Accordingly, the Agreement is void, and Section 601.202 provides that a merchant who violates the notice of right to cancel provisions is liable to the consumer for actual damages suffered by us as the consumer as a result of the violation, reasonable attorney 's fees and court costs. 

In this letter our Texas attorney encouraged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to resolve this matter in a timely manner without the need for further legal action. Our attorney gave them 15 days after the date they received this demand letter to move on the matter. To which they to this day of XX/XX/XXXX have not responded.

This negligence resulted in the termination of my insurance coverage, ultimately causing substantial property damage and personal financial loss. 

Summary of Complaint : This complaint addresses the failure by Flagstar Bank and XXXX XXXX  to fulfill their obligations under the terms of my mortgage agreement by ensuring timely payment of the insurance premium from my escrow account. 

Background and Facts : Mortgage Transfer : My mortgage was serviced by Flagstar Bank until it was transferred/sold to RoundPoint Mortgage XXXX XX/XX/2024. 
I received Notice from Flagstar assuring me that : "" This transfer will not affect the terms of your loan. It will be the same type of loan with the same terms and interest rate. If you have an escrow account with Flagstar, it will transfer to XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, who will make your tax and insurance payments for you. '' ( see attachment ) Escrow Account Setup : As per my mortgage agreement, Flagstar Bank had established an escrow account to cover my homeowners insurance premiums, with the policy set to renew in XX/XX/2024 through XXXX XXXX. 
Failure to Pay Insurance Premium : Renewal notices and billing statements from XXXX XXXX were sent to Flagstar Bank, however, no action was taken by Flagstar to ensure these payments were processed or properly transitioned to XXXX XXXX  Upon transfer, XXXX XXXX  attempted to coordinate with XXXX XXXX but failed to make the necessary payment from my escrow account. 

Resulting Impact Due to the failure of Flagstar Bank and XXXX XXXX  to ensure the continuity of my insurance coverage : My homeowners insurance policy was terminated, leaving my property uninsured. 
Shortly after the termination of my policy, my property sustained water and sewage damage, resulting in significant personal expenses that would have been covered if the policy had remained active.

Damage to household items due to sewage backup.

After making my regular loan payment on XX/XX/year>, including an additional {$540.00} escrow payment, the account should reflect a balance of {$6600.00}.

However, SPS disbursed a late tax payment on my behalf and deducted an additional {$6.00} from my escrow account due to their own negligence. This error violates the terms of our agreement, under which SPS is responsible for managing my escrow account in a manner that avoids penalties and fees. As such, any late fees or penalties due to SPSs failure to disburse payments in a timely manner should not be my responsibility.

I am requesting that the {$6.00} be reimbursed to my escrow account and that a sanction be placed on SPS for their unwarranted handling of my escrow funds. I have sent SPS multiple emails about this issue and have also contacted them numerous times by phone.

When I called to reallocate the payment towards the promotions expiring within 30 instead of the one expiring in XX/XX/XXXX, I was told they couldn't reallocate the payment because it was locked.

In billing cycles in which payments are allocated to deferred interest balances first, the deferred interest balance will be reduced before any other balance on the account ... ..

The Balance transfer checks applied a service fee upon use, and no interest until the promotion expiration date, so why would they say a minimum payment is due for that promotion, but it doesn't show that on my statements?

I have no knowledge of these discrepancies and have not authorized them to be reported. 

This situation is significantly impacting my ability to access basic financial services, and it is causing me considerable hardship. I need a bank account to manage my finances, receive payments, and perform essential transactions. However, the incorrect reporting in ChexSystems is making it impossible for me to open an account, despite my efforts with several financial institutions.

I believe this issue falls under the following regulations : 1. **Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ** Under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C . 1681 et seq. ), consumers have the right to dispute any incorrect or incomplete information on their credit or consumer reports. In this case, the erroneous data reported by ChexSystems is inaccurate and needs to be rectified immediately. 

2. **Consumer Reporting Agencies ' Duty to Correct and Update Information** ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) The FCRA requires that consumer reporting agencies, including ChexSystems, investigate disputes and correct any inaccuracies in a timely manner. I have not received any communication or explanation as to how these errors were made, nor have I been informed of any previous attempts to resolve this issue. 

3. **Right to Privacy and Accuracy in Consumer Reporting** I assert my right under the FCRA to have accurate personal information maintained in consumer reporting agencies, including ChexSystems. The incorrect details on my report are impeding my ability to access services that are essential to my well-being. 

I request that ChexSystems immediately correct the false information on my report and provide written confirmation that the inaccuracies have been removed. Furthermore, I would appreciate it if you could ensure that no financial institution is allowed to deny me an account based on this erroneous data, as doing so is unlawful under the FCRA. 

I am attaching copies of any relevant documentation I have, including my ChexSystems report, to assist with the investigation.

( Marcadis ) and XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( DNF ) for willful violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act ( XXXX ), and other applicable laws. 

Marcadis and XXXX engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by filing a frivolous lawsuit against me, falsely alleging that I owe a debt of {$7000.00}. The lawsuit was signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, a debt collector, who has no legal standing to sue me. Despite my repeated requests, neither Marcadis nor XXXX has provided proof of ownership or a valid chain of title for the alleged debt. Their actions constitute unlawful and deceptive practices under state and federal law. 

Furthermore, prior to these actions, I never provided consent for either Marcadis or XXXX to contact me. Their actions constitute an intrusion upon my seclusion and an infringement of my right to privacy. They unlawfully obtained and used my identifying information without my knowledge or lawful consent. 

Under duress and intimidation, I was coerced into making payments totaling {$800.00}. They threatened harm if I did not comply with their frivolous lawsuit. This coercion, combined with their refusal to provide proper documentation, has caused me significant emotional distress, humiliation, and financial harm. 

I demand that Marcadis and XXXX immediately refund the {$800.00} collected through their unlawful practices and cease all further collection efforts. I will no longer participate in this illegitimate proceeding and will pursue legal action for the violation of my rights under applicable laws. 

Please see the attached documents supporting this complaint.

11/16/2024,Debt collection,Auto debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX IL, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX USAA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX Subject : Demand for Rescission of Consumer Credit Transaction Under 15 U.S.C. 1602, 1635, 1679a, and Related Provisions Dear USAA I am writing to formally address violations under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) concerning my recent consumer credit transaction with USAA. This letter serves as a notice of rescission due to insufficient disclosures regarding my right to rescind, as well as additional violations under relevant provisions of the TILA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

Consumer Credit Transaction and Rescission Rights Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1679a, a consumer credit transaction includes any transaction involving an extension of credit primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. I purchased my vehicle primarily for my familys personal use. My loan contract explicitly identifies this transaction as a consumer credit transaction. However, I was not provided with adequate notice of my right to rescind the transaction as required by 15 U.S.C. 1635. Had I been aware of my right to rescind, I would have exercised this right when title issues and accusations of foul play arose.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( a ), creditors are obligated to disclose the right of rescission for consumer credit transactions. Because USAA failed to disclose this essential information, I am exercising my right to rescind the loan immediately. 

Applicability of 15 U.S.C. 1635 and Definition of Consumer Credit Transactions According to 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( 4 ), the right of rescission applies to all consumer credit transactions consummated on or after XX/XX/XXXX, making my loan eligible for rescission. Additionally, I am aware that residential mortgage transactions are exempt ; however, this exemption does not apply here, as the loan was strictly a consumer credit transaction, not related to a dwelling mortgage as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1602 ( x ).

Additional Violations Under TILA and FCRA USAAs failure to disclose my rescission rights constitutes inadequate disclosure per TILA standards, violating 15 U.S.C. 1602 ( k ). Furthermore, I have experienced a lack of transparency regarding issues with multiple car titles and misleading information in my credit report, which may represent further violations under the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2. USAA knowingly reported inaccurate information, creating financial harm and exacerbating my concerns regarding the transactions integrity. 

Request for Remedy As a result of these violations, I formally demand rescission of my loan in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1635. I expect to retain the vehicle and receive a full refund of all payments made to date, with finance charges zeroed. Furthermore, I request that USAA take immediate steps to rectify any inaccurate or misleading information reported on my credit report to reflect this rescission. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please confirm receipt of this letter and provide details on the steps USAA will take to honor this rescission request in compliance with TILA.

According to the attached "" Notice of Proposal to Accept Collateral in Full Satisfaction of Obligation '' from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, the lender proposed to accept my vehicle ( XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX VIN : XXXX as full satisfaction of my debt. I accepted this proposal on XX/XX/XXXX, as evidenced by my signature on the document. The document clearly states that upon acceptance, I would have no further obligation to pay the remaining debt, and the vehicle would not be considered a repossession. Reporting this account as a repossession is inaccurate and misleading. 


FCRA Violations : Inaccurate Reporting : The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requires that only accurate information be reported. Reporting this account as a repossession violates FCRA provisions by misrepresenting the nature of the agreement ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ).

Failure to Correct Errors : If I dispute this error and it is not corrected, it further violates the FCRA, which mandates that credit reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information within 30 days ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ).

Requested Action : I request that you : Correct the status of this account to reflect that the debt was fully satisfied without repossession.

Remove any negative marks associated with this incorrect repossession from my credit report. 

All credit reporting agencies involved stated they did an investigation and found the provided evidence as insufficient, which is severely incorrect.

11/11/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"I am writing to address the recent decision made by First National Bank of Omaha ( FNBO ) regarding my XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Upon receiving the bank 's letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I noted the reduction of my credit line from {$17000.00} to {$1000.00}. This action signified a 94 % decrease in my revolving credit limit. Accordingly, I am providing additional context and elaboration in the sincere hope that we can reach a beneficial resolution that is also in alignment with FNBOs purpose : to improve the financial well-being of customers. 

As a valued member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  since XXXX, I respectfully express my concern regarding the decision made by FNBO to base its assessment on outdated information from early XXXX that did not accurately reflect my present credit standing in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. My XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX were XXXX and XXXX, respectively, in the middle of the month of XXXX. The XXXX XXXX Score XXXX, Score XXXX, XXXX Score XXXX were rated as very good at XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, respectively, in that same month. 
Presently, the XXXX scores through myXXXX are the following : XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : XXXX First National Bank of Omaha took significant action based on the {$33.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars and XXXX XXXX cents ) statement balance due on XX/XX/XXXX, despite the low credit card utilizationless than 1 % of the {$17000.00} credit limitand minimal debt. Unfortunately, I unintentionally missed the XX/XX/XXXX payment deadline due to mistakenly thinking I had no balance. However, I promptly rectified the situation by making a complete current balance payment on XX/XX/XXXX, which was posted to the account the following day, prior to receiving any correspondence from First National Bank of Omaha. Given my history of timely payments, I earnestly requested a reversal of the late fee from the bank, and FNBO promptly acknowledged and granted my request. 

Because of the actions taken by the bank, I am finding it difficult to continue using this credit card for XXXX ticket purchases due to its low {$1000.00} credit line. As an XXXX XXXX XXXX  member with XXXX XXXX status, I often travel on business or first class. When XXXX announced the launch of its new XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, you were quoted as saying, FNBO is proud to partner with XXXX to provide its customers with a high-quality, comprehensive card program that supports the superior experience and service they receive riding with XXXX XXXX XXXX Due to the financial inability to access the superior experience that you referenced, I now will have to redirect my XXXX spending to my other credit cards, which all have a much higher limit. 

In the correspondence with FNBO, I aimed to convey an unwavering commitment to meeting my financial obligation of nearly {$34.00}. The upward trajectory of my XXXX score served as a testament to this dedication. Moreover, I took proactive measures to prevent any future occurrences by enrolling in the banks auto-pay feature. On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, a First National Bank of Omaha supervisory representative called and left a voicemail from ( XXXX ) XXXX. I returned the telephone call and spoke with XXXX. While he was empathetic about the situation, XXXX, unfortunately, indicated that the bank was unable to reconsider its decision because of an internal policy. He added that the only available option was for me to wait XXXX months. In XX/XX/XXXX, the bank would be able to reassess the situation, but only through a hard rather than soft credit inquiry. As for the severe reduction in my credit limit, the programmed computer algorithm apparently viewed the {$33.00} statement balance even more negatively because the previous months balance was XXXX. Therefore, the credit card issuer evaluated the unpaid debt as a percentage of the total outstanding balance, which includes any unpaid amounts from the previous statement. This figure was calculated at 100 %. In contrast, had I carried a larger balance from the previous statement, it would have resulted in a smaller ratio and the impact may not have resulted in the severe action that FNBO implemented on my credit card account. 
Despite this situation, I believe that my background makes me an ideal customer for First National Bank of Omaha. Moreover, FNBOs website asserts that the bank considers itself a great big, small bank, large enough to provide the expertise and resources necessary to handle any financial need yet small enough to know its customers personally. 

Although I submitted written correspondence to FNBO, the bank has not replied in writing. Through a verbal communication only, FNBO ultimately did not consider this well-reasoned and thoughtfully articulated request to restore my credit limit to its previous level. This adjustment would have greatly assisted in ensuring the continuity of a mutually beneficial partnership that would have been in keeping with FNBOs mission of building and maintaining long-term relationships. The bank was unable to apply its purpose-led approach, which drives how the bank serves its customers to help them achieve their goals, which in my case would be to shift XXXX and other purchases back on my XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OMAHA,NY,11237,None,Consent provided,Web,11/11/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10760091

1. To resolve my first complaint ( submitted on XXXX XXXX, 2024 ), I called the company. A representative ( a woman ) shouted at me with such brazen words : "" I won't answer your questions. Instead, you should answer my questions only with a 'yes ' or 'no '. '' Such a manner demonstrated no respect for customers. She should understand that their customers have the same human dignity and honor as she has. Her ignorant, rude, and unprofessional attitude towards me is unacceptable. I charge this conduct. The company should not hide this issue and must answer my charges. 

2. The company shifted the central issue in the written response. It's about closing my account. Rather than answering, they talked about fees and interest rates. A response such as this shows they are insincere, unethical, unprofessional, incompetent, mindless, or utterly idiotic. In such a manner, they demonstrate disrespect not only for me but also for the Consumer Protection Bureau. This disrespectful behavior needs to be held accountable. This company should answer this matter -- why did you shift the issue? 

3. They stated in their written response to my second complaint ( submitted on XX/XX/year> ) that they were allowed to do whatever they wanted by law even with no reason. As I stated, they abuse the laws, and they have no reason to close my account. I requested to see the third party. I want to be clear about my point. It is the company, not me, who gets approval from a third party regarding their conduct as such, and shows it to me. 

4. It is usual practice that once an account is closed, the balance should remain at the same level as the closing date without adding interest and fees. However, the company deliberately abuses me by imposing more fees and interest. This balance won't be paid until this dispute settles. 

5. The company has demonstrated its rude manners to customers, its incompetence to focus on the issue, and its abuse of the law and customers. Now is the time for them to answer my complaint point by point ( as listed in XXXX points above ) with sincerity and honesty, with which both sides may reach an agreement.

11/15/2024,Debt collection,I do not know,Electronic communications,Frequent or repeated messages,"I am filing this complaint against Allied Interstate LLC due to their unprofessional and obstructive communication practices, which make it impossible for me to address a debt they claim I owe. 

On XX/XX/, I received an email from Allied Interstate LLC stating they had an important communication for me regarding a debt. The email instructed me to click a secure link to access the details, but I opted to call their office directly using the phone number listed on their official website to ensure I was contacting the correct company. 

I made two attempts to reach them : 1. During the first call, I was placed on hold for 10 minutes with automated messages repeating every 15 seconds, asking me to press 1 to leave a message or stay on the line. Despite waiting patiently, no representative ever answered.

2. During the second call, the phone rang less than once before the line went silent. After a few seconds of silence, the call disconnected. 

This pattern of behavior feels like a deliberate tactic to stall consumers from resolving or validating debts, potentially to run out the clock on legal protections or reporting timeframes. It is extremely frustrating, as I contacted them the same day I received their email in an effort to validate the debt. 

These actions raise serious concerns about their practices, particularly when it comes to handling debts and their impact on consumers credit. I am worried they may report this debt to credit bureaus without allowing me the opportunity to request validation or dispute its accuracy.

Resolution Requested : 1. Provide written validation of the debt, including the name of the original creditor and proof that the debt belongs to me.

2. Cease all credit reporting activities related to this debt until validation has been completed and shared with me.

3. Improve their communication practices to ensure consumers can promptly reach representatives to address debts.

11/18/2024,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Compliant Subject : WellsFargo Bank Reasons for Complaint : 1. Fraudulent and predatory actions by bank employee ( s ) resulting in theft of {$9000.00} from savings account 2. Lack of internal security measures or alerts to prevent and safeguard against fraudulent activity.

3. Bank Executive Boards lack of action to investigate theft. Even sending an email to the CEO did not elicit a response. Unwillingness to speak to customer or contact local police department to obtain the police report, which was written at the bank branch within minutes of the theft. Police officer discussed the next steps with the bank manager at that time. There was no collaboration with the police department to investigate this theft.

4. Weeks of misleading the customer to believe that they were actively investigating the facts of the case, only to learn that they opened the case 25 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ) after the theft occurred. Then they send an email on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the case was closed since they found no fraud. No details of the investigation were disclosed. The XXXX XXXX Police Department was never contacted. 

5. Complete failure of fiduciary responsibility to protect customers financial information. Demonstrated by : In response to one of my emails, the WellsFargo Assistance Center sent me an email with someone elses name, case number and the last 4 digits of his Account Number. This is an egregious example of total disregard for security of information. 

Fraud Activity : On XX/XX/XXXX, my daughter who has been on my account for almost 30 years, received a call from WellFargo at this number, XXXX which is the XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX. ( This is a legitimate number for this WellsFargo branch ) The phone number came up as WellsFargo. The caller announced that they were calling from WellsFargo 's fraud department and that they noticed fraudulent activity on my account. To confirm, the caller verified all account numbers, date of births and last 4 digits of social security numbers. He even knew how much money was in the account. Only a bank employee would have that level of specific information. 

The fraud dept representative instructed her to withdraw {$9000.00} in cash from my savings account ; the bank teller at our usual branch did not inquire about the large cash withdrawal she was making. The money was then deposited into the bank 's ATM machine at the branch where our accounts are held. The bank representative instructed her to deposit the money into an account number that he provided. When she then looked at the account the money was not there. Immediately, she informed the bank manager about this occurrence with the expectation that it could be immediately rectified. However, bank employees did not make any effort to trace the account numbers. This all happened in real time at our branch location in XXXX, GA, which we have been customers of for almost 9 years. Fortunately, there was a police officer, XXXX. XXXX, at a nearby parking lot and she asked him to come into the bank and make a report. He took all of the information and explained to the bank manager what the bank needed to do in order for the police dept to investigate this theft. 

Timeline : XX/XX/XXXX Bank manager XXXX gave the name and number for a contact at the executive office, XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I called, I was informed that she is not handling the case and instead XXXX is at XXXX. I left a message, but never received a return call. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called again and was informed that a person named XXXX ( XXXX possibly ) left message but did not receive a return call. 

XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Called again and left message did not receive a return call. 

XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with XXXX  at XXXX. He advised that there is a new case number, and he will be working on the case. Advised that he would call back. 

XX/XX/XXXX Received a generated email response from the Executive Office stating that they are looking into my concern. See Document 1 XXXX I sent an email to the Executive Office responding to their general email response. 
See Document 2 XXXX Received a call from XXXX from phone # XXXX, she provided a new case number. We spoke and she advised that she will be checking into the case and will call me back. 

XXXX Received an Acknowledgement Email from WellsFargo which had another customers name ( a mans name ), his case number and the last 4 digits of his bank account. See Document 3 ( I blacked out the persons account number to avoid further breach of information ). 

XXXX XXXX called, from # XXXX. I did not answer my phone because it came up as Spam. She did leave a message, and I called her back ; however, she did not answer and I left a message. I never heard back from her. 

XX/XX/XXXX Not receiving any further calls or information, I again called the number above and asked for XXXX. Then I was the informed that XXXX was no longer handling my case. Instead a person named XXXX, located out of the US was in charge of my case. I then briefly spoke to him, and he informed me that XXXX was not capable of handling the case and that he now has it, and he just received it today, XX/XX/XXXX. He was very curt and dismissive. I asked to speak to a manager in the US and he connected me to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who informed me that I had to work with XXXX because he was assigned to the case. ( During this conversation, I informed XXXX that I had received and automated response to one of my emails which was addressed to another customer and it contained the last 4 digits of his bank account plus his case number ; however, he gave no response ). No one could give me an explanation of why for almost two weeks I was led to understand that XXXX was actively investigating my case ; we had several discussions and now she was no longer was involved? I was then transferred back to XXXX who was clearly just going through the motions. When I informed him that I would be sending an email to the CEO, he responded, Go ahead. 

XX/XX/XXXX Following the phone call, I received another automated email from the Claims Assistance Center. See Document 4. 

XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with a secretary at the Executive Board and requested an email address that the CEO would actually receive. She provided me with one and I sent an email to his attention. See Document 5.

Received an automated response to my email. See Document 6. 

XX/XX/XXXX Received an email from XXXX stating that the case is closed as they determined that the transaction was authorized. See Document 7 In two days, XXXX was able to make this unsubstantiated determination. WellsFargo never collaborated with the police department, and never spoke with us. This was a calculated scheme on the part of an employee ( s ) of WellsFargo to involve the customer in order for it to appear authorized. Rather than investigating the origin of this fraud, to root out thieving employees and protect their customers, it is easier to just blame this on their customer. 

WellsFargo should be held in government oversight to investigate employees initial and ongoing vetting practices and security clearances. They should be held accountable for mismanagement of customers funds, the lack of security measures, ( exposing customer banking information is a clear failure in security measures ) substandard operational business practices as well as poor customer service. WellsFargos deficiency in all of these banking standards and their blatant disregard to uphold the primary function of all banks, which is to secure customers funds, are all the reasons that resulted in my {$9000.00} being stolen.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,GA,30518,None,Consent provided,Web,11/18/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10873982

11/8/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"Subject : Unjust Loan Denial, Potential Collateral Misrepresentation, and Unwarranted Credit Inquiry by Citibank Complaint Details : 1. Creation of Loan Value from Application and Denial Despite Collateral Potential : I applied for a loan through Citibank on XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> fully meeting the application requirements and providing all necessary personal and financial information, including my Social Security number. I believe that Citibank either : Created Loan Funds from My Application : In certain cases, loan applications are processed in such a way that banks create funds by balancing their internal ledgers against the application. Essentially, the application itself becomes an asset with intrinsic value, allowing the bank to balance its books. This would indicate that the application alone could serve as sufficient collateral to secure the loan. 
Utilized My Application as Collateral with the Federal Reserve : If Citibank went to the Federal Reserve to source funds for my loan, the application would act as a form of promissory note, which should hold value equivalent to the loan amount for the purposes of collateral. The Federal Reserve requires that applications used as collateral meet certain criteria, affirming that my signed application has intrinsic financial value. This should negate any reason for a loan denial based on traditional credit criteria, as the application itself provides the required collateral. 
XXXX. Securitization Practices and Secondary Market Value of Loan Applications : I understand that it is common practice for banks to securitize loans and sell them on the secondary market. For a loan to be securitized and sold, the underlying promissory note or application must hold recognized value. Once signed, the application transforms into a binding promise to pay, which gives it the necessary legal and financial value to be transferred or sold. This supports my belief that my application itself had value and could have served as collateral or an asset for securitization. This fact should have precluded Citibank from denying my loan solely based on credit factors, as the application already met the banks internal funding needs or asset requirements. 
XXXX. Hard Credit Inquiry with No Opt-Out Option and Potential FCRA Violation : During my loan application process, Citibank conducted a hard inquiry on my credit report, which impacted my credit score and limited future financial opportunities. Despite the possibility that my application was sufficient for funding without additional collateral, Citibank did not offer me an opt-out option for the credit inquiry. I believe this may be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), as the inquiry damaged my creditworthiness without my consent. If Citibanks internal processes would have allowed for loan approval by leveraging my application as collateral, then the hard inquiry was both unnecessary and detrimental. 
XXXX. Financial Damages Due to Denial and Credit Impact : The unjust denial of my loan application and the hard credit inquiry have led to measurable financial damages.

I have had a Citi Bank Shop Your Way CC since XXXX  and it is one of my favorite cards to use for daily needs due to the bonus points and special rate offers they frequently send me. I happen to see the request for credit increase listed in the online portal and figured since I hadn't done that for this card in a long time I would request an increase. I normally do this for most of my CC periodically or the company automatically does it since I am an excellent customer. My request ( much to my surprise ) was immediately denied and then I got a message on XX/XX/XXXX saying it was due to "" Unsatisfactory existing account payment history ''. This seemed odd. I called both the number on the paper and the number on the back of my card and talked to at least 3 people for over an hour and they couldn't give me much info, but they didn't see any late payments or anything in system. I was worried that someone had an unauthorized account under my name or something! Then next day on XX/XX/XXXX I get another message that the "" system '' performed a review of my account and with no warning closed my account of 6+ years claiming "" one or more occurrences of late or returned payments in the last 6 months ''. I immediately called and spent another hour on the phone trying to figure out where the heck they came up with that. Cycled through multiple unhelpful people ( probably more like a useless automated system that didn't let them do any customer service ) to a manager. She a least showed some concern but still said there was nothing they could do as it was an automated system review and the system rules did not have an override or any possible oversight. She concluded that 4 months ago I had 2 extra principle payments scheduled on the same day ( way over minimum required monthly payment that was already satisfied ) that got "" returned ''. The only reason that happened is the scheduled payment account they were linked to had been shut down by XXXXXXXX XXXX fraud dept in an abundance of caution at the same time frame the payments were scheduled so the payments were "" returned ''. Manager was nice enough to at least tell me she filed my complaint against the system, but I am not sure if she really did or if that helps anyone as there was no reference and she said it was internal use only. Really sucks to cut ties with a perfectly good customer and I find this to be a horrible business decision.

I had a CD matured on XX/XX/XXXX and I could not go to a branch to close it as I was busy with my job. Since I could not get time to go to a branch, the CD got rolled over with 1.2 % from 4.1 %.

I noticed several unauthorized transactions on my Wells Fargo everyday checking account ending in XXXX. I informed the customer service department and a claim was opened. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my claim had closed under the dispute reason of, dont remember this transaction, which is a statement I never made. Therefore, they denied my claim and I was not refunded for the unauthorized transactions on my account. 

I called the dispute team today at was told that because, I lost my my debit card I would not be refunded for the unauthorized use of my card. 

I have been banking with Wells Fargo for over 20 years, have had a good standing, with CDs and several accounts and credit cards with them. There is clear evidence that I have never used my cards in any other international country nor have ai traveled. 

Once I investigated the transactions on my account I found that there are several charges in other foreign counties. I have never traveled to other counties let alone purchase anything in another country. Additionally, I found that I received emails and text messages in which Wells Fargo flagged my account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text from the Wells Fargo Detection Department asking if I recognized the transactions. I replied No and received a text stating that the card was blocked and that I would have to call the Wells Fargo dispute department in order to allow transactions to process on my account. It is very concerning that although I did my due diligence and reported fraud, Wells Fargo did not do their part as my entrusted bank to take appropriate measurements in order to prevent fraud and protect me from outsiders using my card and earned monies. 

My great standing along with the insurance that is offered by Wells Fargo should suffice the credit I am owed. 


I ask that Wells Fargo reopens my claim and do thier due diligence and further investigate that the transactions do not belong to me.

The issue is pasted here. As I work for XXXX XXXX, management is also aware, they are reconsidering partnering with Barclays in the future. To Whom It May Concern at Barclays Bank/not that you actually care : I am beyond frustrated with the complete incompetence and mismanagement of my account. After being blocked on XX/XX/XXXX due to address, phone number, and PIN updates, I submitted all required documents to your fraud detection team. On XX/XX/XXXX, these documents were verified, I passed all security checks during an outbound call to the verified number on file ( XXXX ), and my account was unblocked. I was even able to make multiple purchases, proving that everything was cleared. Yet, on XX/XX/XXXX, my account was blocked again for the exact same reasons, despite having already been approved. This repeated blocking is unacceptable and highlights a lack of coordination and accuracy in your internal processes. 

Your team has blatantly disregarded the fact that I completed all verifications. Notes on my account are inaccurate, and it appears a XXXX from XXXX XXXX, XXXX, overstepped her authority by re-blocking my account in ultra-blocked mode simply because she did not like the documents providedeven though the verifications team already approved them.

11/18/2024,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,"This complaint alleges that Credit Acceptance Corporation ( XXXX  ) engaged in multiple deceptive, unfair, and abusive practices in violation of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and other applicable federal and state laws. These violations created significant financial hardship and burden, misrepresented credit benefits, and failed to provide legally required transparency on loan terms. Below are the specific claims. 
Failure to Disclose Total Sale Price and Finance Charges Transparently XXXX failed to comply with 12 C.F.R. 1026.18 by not clearly disclosing the total sale price and finance charges separately, instead embedding these in the principal loan amount. This misleading representation of the true cost of credit violates Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) requirements, making XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Inadequate Disclosure of Add-On Product Costs ( XXXX  Insurance XXXX Extended Warranties ) XXXX failed to comply with 12 C.F.R. 1026.18 ( c ), which requires clear itemization and disclosure of optional add-on products. By embedding these optional costs within the financed amount, XXXX violated XXXX, making it civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Unfair Loan-to-Value Ratio on XXXX Vehicles XXXX financing exceeded the fair market value of the vehicle, creating an unfair loan-to-value ratio that burdens borrowers. This practice fails to meet fair lending standards and is considered exploitative, violating the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( d ), and making XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Misrepresentation of APR Due to Hidden Finance Charges XXXX failed to comply with 12 C.F.R. 1026.18 ( d ), which mandates accurate APR disclosure, by embedding finance charges in the principal and underrepresenting the APR. This violation makes XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Deceptive Finance Charges and Principal XXXX XXXX obscured the true finance charges by embedding them within the principal, inflating the loan amount beyond the vehicles fair market value. This violates XXXX, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1638 ( a ) ( 3 ), and creates civil liability for XXXX under 15 U.S.C. 1640.

Failure to Provide Accurate Disclosure of Payment Allocation for Partial Payments XXXX did not comply with 15 U.S.C. 1638 ( a ) ( 8 ), which requires clear disclosures on how partial payments are allocated. This failure makes XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
False Claims Regarding Credit Improvement Opportunities XXXX falsely claimed that the loan would improve my credit, despite loan terms that made default likely. This deceptive representation violates FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681, and the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), making XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Unconscionable Contract Terms and Excessive Interest Rates The contract terms included high-interest rates and repossession conditions that are unconscionable and exploit borrowers. This violates UCC 2-302, CFPA 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), and Michigan Compiled Laws 438.31 regarding usury limits, making XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Misrepresentation of the Loans Purpose and Terms XXXX  misrepresented the loans purpose by implying it could help with credit repair, which is deceptive. This violates CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), and FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45 ( a ), rendering XXXX civilly liable. 
Unclear Arbitration Clause and Restricted Legal Recourse The arbitration clause restricted my right to pursue claims in court, violating CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), and FAA, 9 U.S.C. 1-16, due to lack of transparency. This makes XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Incentivization of Unnecessary Add-On Products XXXX  encouraged unnecessary add-on purchases, such as warranties, without proper disclosure, violating CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( a ) and TILA, 15 U.S.C. 1605 ( a ), making XXXX civilly liable under 15 U.S.C. 1640. 
Violation of State Usury Laws by Concealing Excessive Interest By embedding finance charges in the principal, XXXX effective interest rate XXXX exceed state usury caps. This violates New York General Obligations Law 5-501, Michigan Compiled Laws 438.31, and CFPA 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), making XXXX civilly liable.

Failure to Provide Required Privacy Opt-Out Rights XXXX privacy notice does not clearly inform of opt-out rights, violating GLBA, 15 U.S.C. 6802 ( b ) and FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681b, making XXXX civilly liable. 
Improper Reporting of XXXX Information tXXXX Credit Bureaus XXXX reported loan information in a manner that misrepresented my creditworthiness, violating FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, and CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), making XXXX civilly liable. 
Deceptive Terms Regarding Required Insurance The contract misrepresented requirements for insurance coverage, failing to inform me of my rights to choose my insurer, violating GLBA, 15 U.S.C. 6802, and CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,CREDIT ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION,MI,48335,None,Consent provided,Web,11/18/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10871258

They said that I had assists valuable enough to go through with pursuing a lawsuit against me : a home, vehicle, ect. 

They said I had an over {$6400.00} debt to Old National Bank from an account that closed nearly XXXX  years ago and needed to make a payment right now to avoid being a lawsuit and that they had served me at my current address, which I advised they I had not received any notices. Also, if I did not pay this now I would be served the next day. They offered me discount if I made the payment that day, which was {$2300.00}. Or I could come up with a partial payment and commit to a payment plan and pay the original total amount due. 

I asked for documentation of this debit and was told they did not have the document and I would have to go through the bank. They continued to harass me for payment with the threat of a lien on my car or house and/or jail. I am a XXXX XXXX on XXXX with limited income and several health issues. I was afraid and paid the amount. They also told me it would be reported to the credit bureau as paid in full. I did ask them why this debit was not on my credit report. I was told "" I can not answers ''. Then I talked with my son and his girlfriend works for the bank in question and said it was a scam. I looked on line only to find a complaint with exactly the same threats on XXXX. This person also stated that telephone numbers on line do not match the firm. 

The more I thought about it, this made my sick to my stomach thinking I was scammed. I contacted the Better Business Bureau on XX/XX/year> and filed a complaint.

11/18/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"My wife and I have been engaged with Truist BANK and in particular their Client Resolution senior XXXX in their MORTGAGE DEPARTMENT for over a year for their improper payment of my real estate taxes. As a result of our disputing their payment of our real estate taxes, the issue escalated into over XXXX phone calls, several trips to the local Truist branch, requests to meet in person with any lawyer or bank executive, letter requests for information and finally requests for them to cease calling our home as we felt harassed. All this took place over our objection even though we never missed a payment or were late with a monthly payment. Some person acted without checking our status as senior citizen and unilaterally paid our taxes and that caused the chaos we have suffered through for more than a year.

I am over 80 years of age and they overwhelmed my wife and I with complicated calculations and demands for payment. We made payments and still wanted to dispute their actions but they continue to seek ways to inflict emotional distress rather than resolve the problem.

As we continue to try and resolve this, they keep adding on penalties and fees. I am sure their executives and chief legal counsel in charge of client resolution could not be aware of the pain and suffering that have been inflicted on us by their Client Resolution Specialists as well as violations of the consumer protection laws. If an executive of Truist or their attorney in Texas would just meet with us and review our communications with the senior specialists then I am sure this can be resolved before we take to social media and involve other government agencies or attorneys to assert our rights for the violations committed by their Client Resolution department.

We have not reached out to other government agencies as we hope your department can bring about the meeting we have requested. Truist actual said in writing they have no one to meet with us and their attorneys are too busy and not allowed to talk to us. I am sure the leadership of their organization would want to know how they treat their customers irrespective of our senior status.

I actually think the Client Resolution specialist department are protecting themselves by not escalating our requests for an in person meeting because we have the documentation to assert our claims above and expose their malfeasance and dereliction in meeting their obligations to consumers who are their customers.

I would hope their senior management would want to improve the process that we have had to deal with going forward. At the very least I would if I were in their position of leadership and trust I would want to understand what has taken place.

While we would like to get on with enjoying our retirement, I am not going to be denied the opportunity to educate their management and make the public aware of how Truist treated customers in our position. 
I hope you can assist us by getting the in person meeting and bring this information to light so that our outstanding issues are resolved.

I am currently in negotiations with the second mortgage lender to remove my house from foreclosure status and I have also asked Wells Fargo to help remedy.

The ATM rejected {$200.00} ( Two {$100.00} Bills ) and my deposit total read {$650.00}, the ATM asked if I would like to submit anymore additional bills to my deposit. I flattened out the my two remaining {$100.00} bills and fed them back into the machine. The machine stated again that it could not accept the two bills and it would again be rejecting both of the TWO {$100.00} bills. However this time only ONE single {$100.00} bill came back out of the machine and the ATM deposit total still read {$650.00}. 

I immediately called the Wells Fargo ATM customer service support number and they opened a investigation on my behalf and a few days later gave me a credit for my {$100.00} bill. 

Over a month later on the week of XX/XX/year> I received notice that Wells Fargo had completed their investigation and they had determined the machine did not make any error and that they would be pulling the {$100.00} credit back out of my account. 

I called customer service again on XX/XX/year> to inquire about their investigation because clearly their had been a mistake. The customer service agent said that because the machine hadn't reported any error they closed the investigation and determined it had not incorrectly kept my {$100.00} bill. I asked if anyone had physically audited the machine to make sure the money inside matched what it showed for total deposits. The customer service agent said no. I asked what exactly were the steps they took to determine the machine did not incorrectly keep my {$100.00} bill. The agent told me she couldn't disclose that information fully but as the machine itself was not reporting that any error had been made that ultimately my claim was denied. I told the agent that relying on a machine to send back an appropriate error code when it had already incorrectly kept my bill didn't seem like a reliable investigation to that she had no answer for me. 

I find it very suspicious and bad business practice that Wells Fargo has come back well over a month later to deny my claim and then admitted that during the course of this time no one physically audited the machine ( as I have seen written online is typically how these matters are handled with other banks ).

11/6/2024,Debt collection,Rental debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Unlawful Charges and Safety Concerns at XXXX XXXX  To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding a series of incidents that occurred while I was residing at XXXX XXXX under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as subsequent issues related to unlawful charges being levied against me by the property management. 

In XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, I was approved for relocation through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a government program designed to assist XXXX XXXX XXXX  in relocating to safer housing. The program required that I meet certain safety and living requirements, and I was approved prior to my move. I subsequently moved into an apartment at XXXX XXXX, with the understanding that my safety and well-being would be prioritized. 

During my two-month stay, I experienced multiple serious safety concerns that I reported to the property management office. Within the first 30 days of my residence, I discovered that a neighboring tenant was actively using XXXX which I could smell through the vents in my entire apartment. ( our units shared a wall ) I also observed that this tenant was engaging in peeping XXXX XXXX, as he was caught looking through my window on multiple occasions ( I was living in a studio with a single window, through which the entire apartment was visible ). 

Despite repeatedly reporting these issues to the office, I received no meaningful action or support. When I reported the neighbors behavior, I was advised by the property office to not involve the police. I also expressed my fear for my safety and requested to be relocated to a different unit on the property, as I felt vulnerable living alone as a XXXX woman and had already relocated for safety reasons. My request was denied, and I was left feeling unsafe and unsupported by management. 

The situation escalated further when the maintenance staff entered my apartment without prior notice or consent. When I inquired about this intrusion, I was told it was a "" wellness check, '' though no one had requested such a check. This invasion of privacy was the final straw, and after two months of distress, I decided to vacate the unit.

I returned the keys and left the unit in its original condition, with no outstanding balance. However, nearly XXXX years later, I was informed that the property management was charging me for XXXX XXXX months of rent for a unit I had not occupied. Also left under Nevada Tenants Privacy and Landlord Harassment policies that are in place that allows me to vacate without any extra costs. So, I immediately contacted the office to dispute these charges, but the response I received was unprofessional and dismissive. I was told, "" you will figure it out, '' and the staff became unreasonably aggressive and unhelpful. 

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter, as I believe I am being wrongfully charged by the property. I would also like to express my concerns regarding the failure of the property management to address the serious safety risks I faced during my time there, as well as the lack of adequate response when I reported these issues. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

11/14/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to file a complaint regarding Barclays USAs handling of my JetBlue credit card account ending in XXXX. Recently, Barclays unilaterally reduced my credit limit, which caused an immediate and significant increase in my credit utilization. As a result, my account was reported as "" over the limit, '' which has severely impacted my credit profile and made it nearly impossible for me to obtain a debt consolidation loan. 

This action by Barclays not only led to an increased utilization rate but also negatively affected my payment history as reported on my consumer reports. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( c ), the law defines a "" consumer report '' and excludes "" transactions or experiences '' directly between the consumer and the furnisher. The FCRA was structured by Congress to ensure that such information, including utilization and payment history resulting directly from credit limit changes, is not automatically included in consumer reports. 

By reporting my utilization and payment experience resulting solely from their unilateral credit limit reduction, Barclays USA has effectively violated my rights under the FCRA. This reporting has led to unfair consequences and undermined my ability to responsibly manage my finances by affecting my eligibility for debt consolidation options. 

I am requesting that Barclays USA take corrective action in the following ways : Immediate Removal of this Account from All Consumer Reporting Agencies I request that Barclays cease all reporting of this account to the credit bureaus to comply with FCRA regulations regarding the exclusion of direct transactions or experiences. 

Adjust Utilization Reporting Alternatively, if Barclays intends to continue reporting this account, I request that they revise the utilization rate to reflect no more than 5 % utilization. This adjustment would better represent my financial responsibility and eliminate the damaging effects caused by Barclays decision to reduce my credit limit without consent.

11/8/2024,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Confusing or misleading advertising or marketing,"My main complaint is referring to the known predatory lender Credit Acceptance, as well as XXXX 's XXXX XXXX in XXXX PA XXXX XXXX County ). The first loan was made on XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXhrough the lender stated above. We were required to pay a specific amount for down-payment in order to secure the loan because our credit scores were very low. The down payment was made in cash. The truck immediately had issues and some were repaired by XXXX XXXX  and some we had to cover. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX we once again needed to purchase a vehicle. We went back to XXXX XXXX  and used the same sales rep as before stating he would see what he could do. Once again we had to make a down-payment ( {$2000.00} cash ) and were able to secure another loan. This car also suffered failure within 29 days. I took the car back and that was fixed. A year later for inspection all XXXX tires failed with a tred of XXXX. When i was told this I called XXXX XXXX and demanded new tires and they stated "" the vehicle was sold with legal tred ''. My mechanic stated otherwise. About XXXX of XXXX we realized we absolutely could not keep up on payments for the vehicles and found we were haggled. Comparing the exact same vehicles with XXXX XXXX XXXX we were way overcharged. Even our bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) stated we shouldn't have even been able to secure the XXXX loan let alone a XXXX. They referred to this as predatory lending. Our debt to income ratio was extremely high after obtaining second loan and impossible to pay all of mandory bills. When told this I personally called and spoke with sales rep we went through both times and was told there's nothing I can do. Credit Acceptance made different arrangements for both vehicles and we have been continuously changing them due to not being able to afford the loans. Credit Acceptance also uses threatening and abusive language regularly regarding missing and late payments. The most recent incident was Monday XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX, the Credit Acceptance representative who answered my call started yelling and screaming at me because he was "" holding me accountable '' for back balance on the account that started in XX/XX/XXXX ( my car ). I expressed I was calling to try to get help with account and also stated why I couldn't pay next arrangement. XXXX continued his rage filled and nasty rant even though I repeatedly stated I was not going to speak with him anymore and to transfer me to another agent. He then replied by saying they will hold you accountable as well and would not transfer me. I hung up and called back tp speak with a new agent. I informed her about XXXX and she made a report to his supervisor. This agent told me if I paid {$350.00} today my car wouldn't be in danger of being repossessed. I explained I didn't even have that much money in my account. Then she said if I called tomorrow she couldn't guarantee the same plan as described above. Bottom line is Credit Acceptance and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  knew we couldn't afford these vehicles and still gave us the loans. Now our credit is absolutely horrible and have 2 years of "" missed '' payments for both vehicles reported on our credit. We have made payments the whole time. The standard monthly payment plus additional money to lower back balance. Our bank has told us there is nothing they can even think of to do to help us. Credit Acceptance also expressed even if they did do repossessions of vehicles they will come after us for remaining balances after vehicles are taken to auction and possibly court action. Also, an arbitration agreement was included in sales but is not clear and was not explicitly explained. This is not the first case against Credit Acceptance. They need shut down for their predatory practices. Telling customers they are guaranteed to be approved for a loan every time is exactly how they got my husband and I. I would like to point out the APR is insanely high and I also was not made aware that it would make the monthly APR payments different each month. Some were {$73.00} and some I have recently discovered were in the {$300.00} range. Credit Acceptance also stated that they will not refinance your loan and upon researching refinancing options, no lender would even consider it because Credit Acceptance was the current loan holder.

I have also had continuous problems with only some of my transactions showing in my transaction history, both on my account and, according to my bank, their system. This has caused me to have to pay late fees and/or return payment fees. Kikoff refuses to investigate as to why these transctions are not showing. 

This leads to the reason for this complaint. On XX/XX/year> I paid {$30.00} to XXXX to pay for my internet.

XXXX XXXX set up payment for a XXXX  XXXX credit card from the shared checking account and XXXX XXXX set up payment for a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX credit card from my personal checking account. The {$1600.00} payment was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX & completed on XX/XX/XXXX. The Wells Fargo XXXX assured us that no payment had been made to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX credit card, assured us that she would delete all payees, make a fraud claim for the stolen {$1600.00} payment to XXXX XXXX & temporarily revoked my online banking access for security purposes. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo to reinstate my online banking access & found out that neither fraudulent payee had been removed from my "" Bill Pay '' service, as I was initially promised and another fraudulent payment of {$5000.00} had been made on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX credit card. During that call, The Wells Fargo agent remove the payees & made an additional claim for the stolen {$5000.00}. I made a third call to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX, to follow up on the progress of my claim. During that call the fraud agent informed me that the claim had been denied but that the initial phone call was set to be reviewed, so all hope was not lost. He also informed me that during my initial call on XX/XX/XXXX, the agent should have immediately closed my account and transferred my funds to a new one. As this was never done, the agent proceeded to close my personal checking account and transferred my remaining funds to a new checking account and filed a complaint on my behalf for the mishandling of the initial claim. 

I went into a local branch in XXXX, XXXX and met with the bank manager who was shocked at my story and worked with me to submit another statement of information on my behalf and encouraged me to file a police report. I then filed a police report with the XXXX, XXXX police department for both claims. Submitted them to all three banks involved. I also spoke to my complaint representative who saw many irregularities in the way the payees were added, as it appeared they were added and payments were initiated on the same day, which is not typically possible through the bill pay system. There was also no email sent to me notifying me that bill payees had been added like the the wells fargo system typically will do automatically. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was sent an email from my Wells Fargo customer complaint advocate that Wells Fargo had denied my claim again, stating that this was not fraud and that it appeared that me or someone I know added these payees with my login credentials. I am reporting this here now as I have found out that many others have experienced this exact same fraudulent scenario and Wells Fargo will not stand by them either, aside from one case I discovered that was reported to the CFPB. This is my final hope for a just resolution and an attempt to inspire others to report these incidences so that Wells Fargo can be held accountable to standing behind its customers as any trusted financial institution should.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,922XX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/11/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10755361

Despite multiple requests for correction, my requests have been ignored, violating both the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
XXXX. FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1666b, creditors are required to send periodic statements at least 21 days before the payment due date. The inaccurate late payment reporting on my account suggests a failure to comply with this requirement. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681i mandates that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy of information in consumer files, which has not been upheld in my case. 
Additionally XXXX and XXXX reflect that all payments on this account were made on time, with no late payments reported. However, Experian continues to indicate that there were late payments on this account. This inconsistency is adversely affecting my credit standing, as Experian is the only bureau reporting a negative payment history on this account. 
I am entitled to have inaccurate information removed from my credit report. Given that both XXXX and XXXX have confirmed that my payments were made on time, I request that Experian align my report to accurately reflect my positive payment history. Please investigate this matter and update my report to remove the erroneous late payment status. 

XXXX. TILA Violations : The Truth in Lending Act emphasizes the necessity for accurate and timely disclosures to consumers. The inaccurate reporting of late payments has caused undue harm to my creditworthiness. 

3. Protection Against Non-Payment of Obligations Act ( PAANL ) : This act reinforces the responsibility of creditors to provide timely statements, preventing unfair penalties to consumers. 


I am formally requesting that the inaccurate late payment notation be removed from my credit report immediately.

11/17/2024,Debt collection,I do not know,Threatened to contact someone or share information improperly,Talked to a third-party about your debt,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Subject : Formal Complaint Against ProCollect , Inc . Multiple Violations of Consumer Protection Laws and XXXX XXXX Compliance To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to file a formal complaint against ProCollect , Inc., regarding their egregious violations of federal consumer protection laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and XXXX XXXX Compliance Guidelines, related to an alleged debt that they reported to the credit bureaus without following proper legal protocols. Their actions are not only unlawful but have caused me significant harm, including undue stress, credit denials, and reputational damage. 

Violations Committed by ProCollect 1. Failure to Provide Initial Communication Before Reporting ( FDCPA and CFPB Debt Collection Rule ) 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ) of the FDCPA requires that debt collectors provide a written notice of the debt within five days of the initial communication, detailing the amount, creditor, and my rights to dispute or request validation. ProCollect failed to send any written notice prior to reporting this alleged debt.

The CFPB Debt Collection Rule mandates that debt collectors must contact the consumer before furnishing information to credit bureaus and wait at least 14 days to ensure their communication was not returned as undeliverable. ProCollect did not attempt to contact me prior to reporting this fraudulent account, violating this requirement.

2. Failure to Validate Debt Before Verification ( FDCPA 1692g ( b ) ) After I disputed the alleged debt, ProCollect claimed to have verified it without providing proper validation as required by law. This verification was arbitrary and non-compliant with XXXX XXXX reporting standards, which require accurate and substantiated data. 

3. Reporting False or Misleading Information to Credit Bureaus ( FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ) ProCollect furnished information to credit bureaus without ensuring its accuracy or legitimacy, violating FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which mandates the reporting of accurate information.

Despite being notified of the dispute, ProCollect continued to report this account as verified, without conducting a proper investigation, violating FCRA 1681s-2 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - ( E ). 

XXXX. Non-Compliance with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX compliance guidelines require furnishers of data to credit reporting agencies to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of their reporting. 
ProCollect failed to : Validate the alleged debt with proper documentation before reporting.

Update the status of the disputed account in compliance with the Consumer Data Industry Association ( CDIA ) XXXX XXXX guidelines. 
Follow the Compliance Condition Code XB, which should be applied to disputed accounts. ProCollect has blatantly ignored these obligations.

Impact on Me as a Consumer Stress and Harm : ProCollects unlawful actions have caused undue stress, damaged my financial reputation, and resulted in denied credit applications.

Violation of My Consumer Rights : Their behavior demonstrates a clear disregard for federal laws designed to protect consumers like me.

Relief Requested I request the following actions be taken immediately : XXXX. Immediate Removal of the Fraudulent Account : ProCollect must delete this account from all credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). 
2. Investigation and Enforcement : The CFPB must investigate ProCollects systematic violations and hold them accountable through enforcement actions.

3. Consumer Protection : Require ProCollect to cease all collection efforts and comply with XXXX XXXX and federal consumer protection laws. 

Next Steps Should this issue remain unresolved, I am prepared to escalate the matter by filing lawsuits for violations of the FDCPA, FCRA, and state consumer protection laws. I will also seek damages for emotional distress, legal fees, and any financial harm caused by their misconduct. 

I trust the CFPB will take swift action to address this matter and prevent further harm to consumers like me.

11/8/2024,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Fraud or scam,None,"General Obligation : Commencing on or around XX/XX/year>, I fell victim to a multi-layered scam operation run by XXXX which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX USD from my Bank of America account to fraudulent investment firm ( XXXX ). 
I was looking for a job, so I decided to put my resume on XXXX. Then, someone contacted me and offered me a job. The job description was that they were doing reviews for the company called COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF Page 2 of 6 XX/XX/year> Page 2 of 6 XXXX operating under the domain - XXXX. At first, I thought this was legit, and the scammers convinced me that this was an easy way to earn money, which I needed at the moment. 
For that reason, I thought this was a good idea. 
I would've never sent the funds if I was aware that this could happen. I didnt know that there are criminals tricking people like this, and the bank did nothing to warn me about this and inform me of the risks involved. 

When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability ; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following ( i ) whether Bank of America did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; ( ii ) whether by virtue of Bank of Americas custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached ; ( iii ) whether Bank of America promoted the transaction ( s ) in question despite being aware of the nature of the transaction ( s ) in question ( iv ) whether Bank of America was in compliance with its own policies and procedures ; ( v ) whether Bank of America owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether Bank of America did not uphold those duties ; ( vi ) whether Bank of Americas conduct was unfair ; and ( vii ) whether Bank of America has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me. 
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant criteria of fraud. 
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent banker. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not turn a blind eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In other words, Bank of America must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have known that I was dealing with a scammer. 
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective element. 
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of the evidence suggests that Bank of America did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers in this respect. 
Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the past.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",FL,33173,None,Consent provided,Web,11/8/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10732839

11/5/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"Citibank Most recently I called XXXX and spoke to a representative named XXXX. I asked him to speak to a manager. He told me that one of my security questions failed, which was what is your mothers maiden name. I said XXXX that is her maiden name. He told me that was incorrect. I asked him was there anything else I could confirm to be able to speak to a manager, long story short, he did not connect me with a manager and hung up on me. 
I have had nothing but difficulties with basic banking needs going back to last year when I attempted to do business with them the first time. I opened an account and encountered many issues in just establishing my pin and accessing online services. I called several times and spoke to different representatives And everything they told me did not work. Under frustration I set it aside. This year when I attempted to use my Citibank account, I was informed that my account was closed. That was the first time I heard that : I never got any emails nor mail correspondence for statements or in regards to the closing of my account plus the 25 that I deposited, when I open the account was eaten up by fees and Closed. 
At that time, I opened a new account and have run into the same issues. I keep getting transferred over and over again. Everybody says something different. One time I was actually transferred to a manager and she told me that I could obtain my account number at a branch. I accepted that and got off the phone when I looked for branches near me. There are none. She was not knowledgeable enough to look at my address and know that they had no branches in XXXX. 
Once I attempted to use my new card at the gas station, It didnt work, I was on The phone for 20 minutes. The representative assured me that the card was active I got off the phone and attempted to pump my gas and it did not work. When I called about the card, they told me that I needed to order a new one, even though I had just received that one and when I received the new one CVC code was CIL. AGAIN! I just so happened to be on the phone with a representative because my XXXX wont work And ask him why my new card had CIL as the CVC code and he informed me that is because this is only an ATM card. I had no idea. And with all the calls I made about the card no representative informed me And every representative that I talked to in regards to this did not pick up on the fact that it was only an ATM card. Nobody told me. I can not understand why I would not be issued a debit card That is also an ATM card?? Very confused? Before my direct deposit came in I was charged for checks and it put my account in the negative. When I establish the account over the phone with a live representative, I was told that those checks would be free. When I called to ask why I had been charged, the representative told me that they no longer issue free checks. When I informed her that the live representative that set up the account said they were free she went ahead and issued a refund.. Whenever I call, I get transferred over and over and have to repeat myself over and over. Today when I asked the first person, I spoke to inform the new representative that I have already identified myself and explained the situation and could he tell the next representative what was going on? He said OK. And did another cold transfer. The level of customer service is unhelpful, ubknowledgeable, and rude. Nobody knows anything, and even when I was in distress and trying to speak to a manager, the representative hung up on me TODAY! XXXX XXXX. Every single thing that is normal for a bank account. I have to call them and inquire on why mine isnt working. XXXX is not working right now. Every time I try to use it it says that my account says its unavailable due to my current account status. My account status is active and there are funds in my account. I set my direct deposit to be sent here and in order to access my funds. I have to transfer to my other bank because none of this other access points are available.

This request is made under my rights as a consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g. 

I previously requested validation of this alleged debt and expected a response in compliance with the FDCPA, which mandates providing sufficient verification and details beyond a mere bill statement. The law requires the original creditors identity, amount owed, and validation that this debt belongs to me. Providing a statement or account summary does not fulfill these requirements, nor does it substantiate the accuracy of the debt. 

As FirstSource Advantage has failed to provide proper validation, I demand that : All inaccurate information be removed from my credit report within 15 days of this letter, as its continued reporting constitutes a violation of the FCRA and may result in damages to my creditworthiness. 

No further contact be made with me about this alleged debt, as outlined under 15 U.S.C. 1692c ( c ) of the FDCPA. I hereby issue a formal cease-and-desist on all communications regarding this matter. 

Failure to comply will leave me no choice but to file a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my state attorney generals office.

11/5/2024,Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Repossession,Company explaining amount owed,"I am writing to formally dispute the repossession and charge-off entry related to the auto lease with Hyundai Finance ( Account Number : XXXX ), currently reported on my credit report. The entry shows a balance of {$8100.00}, and indicates a repossession was conducted in [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ]. 

According to UCC Article 9, specifically Section 9-613, a secured party is required to provide the debtor with a Notice of Sale prior to the sale of the repossessed vehicle. To date, I have not received such a notice. As a result, I believe that the repossession entry on my credit report is inaccurate and does not comply with the legal requirements set forth under UCC Article 9, which mandates that the debtor be notified before the sale of repossessed property.

In light of this, I am requesting the following from Hyundai Finance or the credit reporting agency : 1.Proof of the Notice of Sale that was sent to me regarding the sale of the repossessed vehicle.

2. The exact date and method by which the notice was sent to me.

3. A copy of the sale or disposition of the vehicle, if the property was indeed sold.

Since the repossession and charge-off appear to be in violation of my legal rights under the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Article 9, and since I never received the required Notice of Sale, I respectfully request that this entry be investigated and either corrected or removed from my credit report.

Please provide the requested documentation or correct the account information in accordance with UCC Section 9-613. If I do not receive this documentation within the required 30-day period, I will consider this entry inaccurate and will take further action to have it removed.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to investigate the accuracy of this information within 30 days. Please confirm the outcome of your investigation to me in writing.

I received a Notice of Default letter form US Bank. I am confused regarding this letter. I have requested for an authenticated Statement of Account which to this day I have yet to receive. Mailed via Certified Mail XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Tracking # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Received on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX. Which US Bank had 14 days to respond as per the Uniform Commercial Code 9-210 and Florida Statute 679.210 ( 1 ) ( d ) & ( 5 ). What was sent was dated XX/XX/XXXX. Clearly past the 14 days required by law and only copies of past payments and a printout of payments made the past few years without an actual authenticated Statement of Account. A Letter of Default was then mailed on XX/XX/XXXX, via Certified Mail tracking # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Received on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX. No response received regarding the default notice. A Payoff letter ( Negotiable Instrument ) was sent to me with the XX/XX/XXXX envelope and a as sign of good faith I endorsed the order to pay and remitted back Without Recourse payable to US Bank via Registered Mail tracking # RF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Received on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX, along with a legal notice and clear instructions on what to do with the instrument within fifteen ( 15 ) days from the date of receipt. As of today, I have yet to receive any response regarding the instrument or receive the instrument back. I also mailed a response letter addressing the default notice via certified mail on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  tracking # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. No response received as of today XX/XX/XXXX. 
I am aware that Federal Reserve Notes are negotiable instruments ; they are a promise to pay, and as per the Trading With the Enemy Act along with The Bills of Exchange Act, Securities Exchange Act and The Federal Reserve Act to name a few, only the Federal Reserve Governors are supposed to be using Federal Reserve Notes at their discretion and the general public is to discharge any debt by endorsing the Negotiable ( transferable ) instrument and remitting back via registered mail as a security back to the bank who is a Security Transfer Agent to take the instrument for presentation to the Treasury to get redeemed in lawful money on demand to discharge the debt. No one in this country has been able to pay a debt since The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 when the gold and silver were confiscated, replaced by Negotiable Instruments. XXXX - Debt Discharge : The resolution prohibits payment of debt and substitutes a discharge of obligation, bypassing the absolute prohibition engineered into the Constitution I now realize I have been operating in dishonor by using Federal Reserve Notes as payment instead of discharging the debt. I am now attempting to operate in honor and US Bank can not demand only Federal Reserve Notes as the only payment to keep me in dishonor. 
Or is US Bank attempting to entice me into XXXX? 
18 U.S. Code 1581 : Makes it illegal to hold someone in peonage, or debt servitude, by using force, threats, or legal coercion. It also prohibits obstructing the enforcement of this law.

42 U.S. Code 1994 : Abolishes peonage and declares null and void any laws that establish or enforce it.

18 U.S. Code 1593A : Prohibits financially benefiting from peonage or slavery.

A tender of payment has been submitted to and received by US Bank.

UCC 3-603 Tender of Payment. 
( b ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to which the tender relates.

UCC 3-604 Discharge by Cancellation or Renunciation.

( a ) A person entitled to enforce an instrument, with or without consideration, may discharge the obligation of a party to pay the instrument ( i ) by an intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation, or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out of the party 's signature, or the addition of words to the instrument indicating discharge, or ( ii ) by agreeing not to sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a signed record.

The Constitution Article 1 Section 10 states : No state shall make Anything but gold and silver coin a tender of payment of debts. 
From House Joint Resolution XXXX, On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX enacted XXXX to suspend the gold standard and to abrogate the gold clause. This resolution declared that "" Whereas the holding or dealing in gold affect the public interest and are therefore subject to proper regulation and restriction ; and whereas the existing emergency has disclosed that provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency... are inconsistent with the declared policy of congress... in the payment of debts. 
This resolution declared that any obligation requiring "" payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency, or in an amount in money policy ; and... Every obligation heretofore or hereafter incurred, shall be discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts. '' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : MONEY. In usual and ordinary acceptation it means gold, silver, or paper money used as circulating medium of exchange, And does not embrace notes, bonds, evidences of debt, or other personal or real estate. 
Bills of Exchange Act ( definitions ) Bill means bill of exchange, and note means promissory note.

Basically the Note which was unknowingly signed as a blank endorsement at closing, allowed XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to transfer it payable it to the order of US Bank. Which US Bank has monetized and no longer has the original instrument of indebtedness ( Note ) in its original form. 
US Bank has access to The Federal Reserve Window. 
The Federal Reserve Act section 16 ( 2 ) states : 2. Application for notes by Federal Reserve banks Any Federal Reserve bank may make application to the local Federal Reserve agent for such amount of the Federal Reserve notes hereinbefore provided for as it may require. Such application shall be accompanied with a tender to the local Federal Reserve agent of collateral in amount equal to the sum of the Federal Reserve notes thus applied for and issued pursuant to such application. The collateral security thus offered shall be notes, drafts, bills of exchange, or acceptances. 
It is very odd that no one from US Bank has responded back to the letter of Default or to my registered security Payoff and Legal Notice, except for this default threat of foreclosure.

18 U.S. Code 1581 Makes it illegal to hold someone in peonage, or debt servitude, by using force, threats, or legal coercion. It also prohibits obstructing the enforcement of this law.

No one at US Bank wants to authenticate any correspondence sent to me. Is no representative of US Bank confident enough to authenticate a respond and explain why US Bank is exempt from the above legislation?

22 CFR 92.36 Authentication defined. 
An authentication is a certification of the genuineness of the official character, i.e., signature and seal. 
So now can any representative from US Bank authenticate a response with an affidavit under penalty of purgery and full commercial liability as to why my registered security has not been presented to the Treasury to settle the account or returned to me with an explanation as to why your organization is exempt from the above legislation and why the commercial instrument is unacceptable for discharge and payment? 
I have a few more questions to ask. 
1. Is there a Principal Balance?

2. Who is the Principal Balance owed to?

3. Is US Bank the Payor or the Payee?

Now, after 6 months from that and after talking to Citi dispute department over 10 times ( and over 10-12 hours ), they still haven't refunded my money yet.

On XX/XX/year>, I applied for the U.S. Bank XXXX XXXX credit card through U.S. Banks website, explicitly seeking a {$30000.00} balance transfer. I entered this requirement during the application process, and the website indicated that my request was approved. However, when I reached the final screen to confirm my account details, I discovered that I was only granted a {$7000.00} credit limitsubstantially less than the balance transfer I needed. 

This unexpected limit made the card unsuitable for my purposes. I immediately contacted U.S. Banks customer service to close the account, as the approved limit was not what I had initially applied for or what was represented during the process. 

I feel that this experience reflects a bait and switch tactic, as I was led to believe I would be receiving sufficient credit to accommodate my balance transfer. Such practices are not only frustrating but also misleading, as they create unnecessary inquiries on my credit report and waste consumers time and resources. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope this issue will be reviewed to prevent similar experiences for other consumers.

11/5/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX my husband received a fraud alert from USAA that stated two people we did not know had been added to his banking profile. We called in to the main USAA number ( XXXX ) and were told that someone unauthorized had accessed one or more of our accounts, but they would not provide any specific information. The person we initially talked to took a fraud report, but we were cut off when they transferred us. I called in and spoke to another representative who froze our accounts and walked us through changing our PINS and passwords. We were told the fraud department would launch an investigation and would contact us right away. In the meantime we would have no access to our accounts. They said this would take XXXX days. We would only be able to gain information by calling in ( we can not see anything on online banking ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX my husband I seperately talked to XXXX in the fraud department. We were asked a lot of questions about whether we had shared our account information, clicked on potentially fraudulent links, talked to someone other than USAA. We had not done any of those things. When I pressed her for more information, XXXX told me that two people unknown to us had been added to two of our joint accounts. That person had deposited a {$100000.00} check and then sent our wire transers for the same amount to unknown accounts. They were also added to a Savings account but took no action.

When I asked what our liabiity was in this situation she was cagey with me and said it depended on what they found in their investigation. I looked up the information and learned that the bank is responsible unless we authorized the transaction, which we most certainly did not. 

On XXXX I followed up with the fraud department, concerned that the payments I sent out via bill pay for our mortgage and XXXX bills would not be paid. I was assured that those checks had been sent and would be honored. On XXXX I received a notice that our gas bill had not been paid because XXXX was denied the funds. I also received notice of an overdraft for insufficient funds on the account where the fraud was committed. 

Now ( a week later ) all of our accounts are frozen, we have no access to our money, can not pay our bills and USAA has not notified us of the results of their "" investigation. '' We have been USAA members for 30 years and our accounts have always been in good standing. We have several checking accounts, a savings account, CD and annuity with them. They also handle our auto insurance. When my husband called in to check the status of the investigation, he was told that they were leaning towards blaming us for the {$100000.00} fraud. 

What doesn't make sense to us : WHY did USAA allow someone to add themselves to my husband 's profile as a relative without contacting us for permission? 
WHY did USAA allow this fraudster to deposit a {$100000.00} bad check in our account and then send out immediate transfers? When we have deposited a large check in the past we have had to wait for funds to clear before being able to access the funds. This is bad business practice on their part. 

After 30 years with USAA, we are being treated like criminals. We can't access our accounts and no one is communicating with us, unless they are trying to trick us into saying something incriminating that makes this our fault.

Some one is lieing and trying to cover there XXXX. 
I guess what they didnt seem to take into consideration is me quitting my job and them not being able to garnish my wages. They cant get a new garnishment because they no longer have the Lien to hold against me.

Theres also the fact that I was the co signer on the vehicle and never once did they try to collect the money from the buyer. 
I need this garnishment stopped I am the soul provider for my household and its affecting my whole life.

As this is a material error, I request the immediate correction of the name associated with this account to reflect the correct details. Please update this entry accordingly.

2. Multiple Charge-Off Entries : Additionally, I have noticed that the account has been reported as charged off multiple times, which is an error. Under FCRA 605 and FCRA 623, a charge-off can only be reported once. The repeated reporting of charge-offs on this account is misleading and inaccurate.

As per FCRA 605, charge-offs are a one-time event and should only be listed once. The repeated reporting of charge-offs violates the guidelines set forth by the FCRA, as it misrepresents the status of the account.

I request that the multiple charge-off entries be corrected by ensuring that only one charge-off is reported for this account.

Request for Immediate Investigation : In accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1681i of the FCRA, I request a thorough investigation into both of these issues. Please provide proof from the creditor regarding the date and legitimacy of the charge-off ( s ) and ensure that the account is reported accurately, with the proper name and a single charge-off entry.

11/7/2024,Debt collection,Rental debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"Upon looking at my credit score it appears that this debt impacted it and thats how I even knew I had a debt to be payed. It was to my knowledge that if I forfeited my lease then my balances would be considered gone. Apparently thats not the case. Now this situation in its self is very complicated and I understand there were multiple times I couldve done something to change my fate but unfortunately Im very young with no prior understanding of a lease or what it means to not pay certain things. In XXXX of 2023 The complex reached out to me as an act to discuss my balance of {$200.00} that I had inquired in late fees or just a payment I didnt make in XXXX. Nonetheless when I returned in XXXX after the break I went to the office and spoke to the manager. She advice me that XXXX   XXXX had this one time waiver fee that would give me the {$200.00} I paid back to me. But in order to do that I had to pay that plus XXXX rent. They also advise me that any late fees I rack up in that time will be covered because I signed that form. Everything had to be payed by the last day in XXXX. I informed her of my financial situation and she instead that this would be a good idea and I should just make sure my school and job pay me on time. I worked in XXXX and I was expected to get payed before the due date of when I needed to pay the money to the apartment. I was in the clear with my job but unfortunately the amount they were going to pay me wasnt enough and I still wouldve been short. I told her and she asked me to ask friends and family and see if anyone would help me. I know trust a few friends and family to ask for money and unfortunately they all didnt have it I even had people who owed me money still and I asked them for the money they owed me and none of them could or would give it back at that time. The other issue was my school I called them to see when I was going to get my refund money but they informed me that because I already have my school payed for they can give me my money sooner and that it would be sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX which was 2 days after the date XXXX  XXXX and I agreed on. I informed XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX manager ) about the situation. I asked her if I could just pay with the money I currently have which was around {$800.00} and but amount I needed to pay was {$1000.00} I believe and she said the form I signed would t be null void and they wouldnt pay me the {$200.00} back or cover the late fees Ive gather and I would have to pay way more money. Obviously because I didnt want to pay more money then what we agreed I didnt pay with the money that I had and I waited. I continued to beg my school but they said I had to wait for XXXX because I didnt need the money sooner since my school was covered. Finally the time came which was XXXX and I begged XXXX to please extended the date so I can pay what we agreed. The amount of late fees that I had racked up by XX/XX/XXXX were so much that I only had enough money for what we agreed on. I asked her what could be done and she said I had to just pay everything at that point and our agreement was now voided. I tried to pay but they wouldnt let me pay on the resident app anymore. She said I could get a cashiers check, or a money order. Due to the fact that my bank wasnt in XXXX I couldnt get a check from them. Also money ordered apparently werent only sold at certain places and the 3 places I went were either closed or being difficult. I informed XXXX about all of this because she told me to keep her updated. Her communication towards the last week of XXXX and me finally leaving XXXX  XXXX was so horrible for a manager. A lot of things couldve been avoided or communicated better but she wasnt responding until hours to days on end later. Finally I asked her what options I could do now if I dont want to pay because I couldnt even do a payment plan at they point. And she informed me that I could just forfeit my lease. The crazy thing about all of this is that in XXXX I wanted to leave the XXXX  XXXX and I had no bills or anything to pay them I just hated the place and it had bugs but, they said they said I couldnt leave and if I did I would still have to pay rent. I thought this was crazy because I dont remember seeing this in my lease but it wasnt highlighted nor did they state this when I was signing. They mentioned everything else but the important stuff they practically hid stuff from me so I could sign my lease. They took advantage of my being naive and young. I know for a fact they couldnt be able to pull half the craziness they did if I was well knowledge in the world of owning a lease and living somewhere. But when I had a huge balance thats when they allowed me to leave which is very unfortunate. I decided to choose the last option in her email which said I could give up my lease and theyll just send everything to their other office. But the way she explained it made me believe that I was feeling if any payments and I can move on with my life. Unfortunately this wasnt true. Im writing this letter to plead with whomever is reading and can understand what its like to be hoodwinked and wrapped into a tricky situation. I understand at any point I didnt have to listen to XXXX or The complex and I couldve did my own thing but I was young and its their company so they know whats best, ( well at least thats what I thought ), I truly apologize that you guys even have to deal with such a situation but Im not a criminal I have done XXXX  XXXX no wrong. In fact I payed my bills on time and I was very rarely late. The sad part is that is wouldnt even mind paying the 1 and 1/2 month of rent I owed. But the complex failed me tremendously. I was a good tenant and I took care of their property and kept my apartment clean always. I look forward to hearing from you guys soon and hopefully we can come to a conclusion that works in everyones favor, Thank you, Account number : XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"ProCollect, Inc.",KY,40219,None,Consent provided,Web,11/7/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10710614
11/7/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received from Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing an Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement dated XX/XX/XXXX. Page XXXX of the Statement erroneously listed an "" Anticipated Payment '' from escrow in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$7100.00} for "" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. This caused my new total monthly payment to increase from {$530.00} to {$1200.00}! My condo unit is only XXXX square feet. My apartment is one of XXXX units in my condo building. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I advised Shellpoint via their "" Contact Us Page '' that the XXXX XXXX XXXX Insurance premium is not paid through my escrow account ; that I pay my monthly XXXX fees to my condo association and the condominium association pays the {$7100.00} premium to the insurance company because this policy covers the ENTIRE BUILDING which consists of XXXX condominium units, including mine. I also faxed a letter with the same explanation to XXXX and mailed the letter to Shellpoint, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. In all of my communications, I requested the monthly payment amount be recalculated once the erroneous {$7100.00} "" Anticipated Payment '' was removed. I attached a copy of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to each correspondence. It shows that the insured is my condo association. 

I also spoke with Shellpoint 's insurance department on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX advised she updated the XXXX XXXX XXXX payout to XXXX and that I was to contact Shellpoint Customer Service to request a rerun of the escrow analysis recalculating the monthly payment amount after the erroneous {$7100.00} "" Anticipated Payment '' was removed. I did so on XX/XX/XXXX. I have followed up with phone calls on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX to inquire as to the status of my request and was always told Shellpoint was working on it. 

To keep my account current, to avoid late fees, and to keep Shellpoint from reporting a late payment to credit bureaus, I was forced to pay the incorrect amount of {$1200.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. 

My online account with Shellpoint reflects that the {$7100.00} was removed from the Taxes and Insurance page, but Shellpoint has not yet provided a corrected escrow analysis nor have they reduced the monthly total amount due to the correct amount. It still shows a monthly amount due on XX/XX/XXXX of {$1200.00}. 

Shellpoint has sent me letters - none of which address the issue at hand and all of which are vague, indefinite form letters which include no reference to my specific issue nor what steps Shellpoint is taking to correct their error. My correspondence, Shellpoint 's correspondence, the Escrow Analysis, and the erroneous XXXX XXXX monthly mortgage statement are attached. 

Shellpoint has been advised they made a mistake, but it is not taking any action to correct it.

The FCRA and GLBA, along with state privacy laws, impose strict guidelines to protect consumer information from unauthorized access and disclosure. Unauthorized access and use of my information without my explicit authorization raise serious concerns about data protection and compliance with these regulations. As such, unauthorized handling of my information by Eastern Account System or any other third party can subject both entities to criminal and civil penalties.

Criminal charges be pursued if it is found that my information was improperly accessed or shared with XXXX XXXX without my explicit consent. 
While I understand that Eastern Account System may have processes in place for notifying consumers, it is my position that these processes should not override the fundamental privacy rights outlined by federal and state regulations.

11/10/2024,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Account # ending in XXXX - I called and talked to XXXX over a week ago regarding a {$200.00} payment to XXXX XXXX that I wanted to dispute. XXXX said that I would be hearing back from Ally. Of course, I haven't heard anything at this time and I'm wondering when the response will be forthcoming? 

On XX/XX/year>, I talked to XXXX ( XXXX ) at XXXX, asking to speak to XXXX from XXXX regarding the email received from her dated XX/XX/year>. Of course, I couldn't speak to her as no one is available in that department - and XXXX conveniently left off any personal contact information. That is the policy of Ally Bank- as there is a huge track record of no returned phone calls from XXXX XXXX especially. If XXXX doesn't acknowledge the issue and gather the information - that secures a good outcome for Ally Bank- as delivered by 'XXXX XXXX ( who lied to me when he knew nothing of the details of the case and told me that he would submit my concerns which he DID NOT do, as confirmed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had me on hold for an hour and twelve minutes yesterday and finally got XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  supervisor who couldn't answer any of my questions as I was extremely upset with this continued nightmare which began on XX/XX/year> and the lies just told to me by XXXX from her email response dated XX/XX/year>. Ally Bank maximizes people that are figure heads only - and especially the people in XXXX - who continue with the usual talking points that 'they have no further information ' and I should have a 'wonderful day ' in conclusion. 

XXXX 's email of XX/XX/year> has several untrue statements in the information sent - after she spent 3 paragraphs lecturing me on fraud. Supposedly, Ally Bank is on the cutting edge in preventing fraud - but did NOT protect my accounts or my funds. I called Ally Bank on XX/XX/year> and said : "" I am the victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and I want my accounts frozen ''. Case # XXXX. WAS THIS MESSAGE ON MY ACCOUNTS- as how could anyone, in XXXX 's words demonstrate "" award winning customer care ' and not shut my accounts down at that very moment? No, XXXX shuts my accounts down after my funds are gone conveniently and XXXX XXXX said that the wires were authorized - to support the XXXX fraud liability of Ally. Nothing unauthorized about a fraudulent XXXX from Ally 's Fraud Department on my computer initiating, creating and submitting wire requests- telling me that my accounts are being used to send money in and out and that 'this is an inside job at Ally Bank XXXX and must be investigated. I was continually threatened that I could not talk to ANYONE and that if I got on my accounts, I would be considered the3rd party. How could I - as XXXX had my computer screen locked for 5 days committing fraud in conjunction with a fraudulent person from XXXX and a fraudulent person from FTC? A person from the FBI told me that this is a common fraud scheme - so how could ALLY Bank, who is on the cutting edge of preventing fraud per XXXX 's email, not shut this all down when I am alerting Ally Bank that I am the victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and I want my accounts frozen BEFORE anything happened? 

XXXX said that I authorized a second transfer - don't know the amount - but I DID NOT. If anyone from Ally Bank would please review the 30-40+ recorded phone calls, maybe some truth would be known. For the first wire of {$9400.00}, I didn't even know the bank name - which should have been the second clear sign that the wire was fraudulent - AFTER the supposed notes on my account were never entered, that I AM THE VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT AND A MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEME AND WANT MY ACCOUNTS FROZEN. I was called by the award winning employee from Ally to verify whether I made a transfer of $ XXXX on XX/XX/year> and I said, "" UHHH, I WILL HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK ''. XXXX, was that phone call reviewed- as I didn't even know that the fraudsters had made that transfer- which was certainly unauthorized? I NEVER called back, and then another women called and asked if I use an XXXX and a XXXX computer. She said something like 'that is pretty much all I need to know then '' - which proves what? I merely said yes - but since the fraudsters were on my computer with the screen locked that gives authority? XXXX, did you review that phone call - or does Ally Bank only cherry pick phone calls to support their narrative/decision only? 

XXXX said that the wire requests were received via XXXX from my savings account. Since I have NEVER requested a wire and have no idea what XXXX  even means, why does no one figure out that they are on my computer as I said on XX/XX/year> that I was the victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and wanted my accounts frozen BEFORE anything had happened? No notes on account to protect me and my funds? Regardless, XXXX said that Ally Bank has cutting edge technology to prevent wire fraud. No unusual or suspicious activity on my account when XXXX wires were sent in the matter of 3 days to wipe out all of my funds in the amount of {$54000.00}. What are they looking at, as I am being threatened continually to not say a word to anyone as this is an inside job and the investigation is ongoing from XXXX from Ally 's Fraud Department through a spoofed phone number and my computer is locked. 

Before the third wire was sent ( which included the fraudulent $ XXXX transferred funds ), the wire was apparently requested some time in the morning by the fraudster, creating and submitting the wire request, and kept calling me to check on the wire throughout the day, why the wire wasn't completed. When XXXXXXXX XXXX ( wire cutoff time per the fraudster ), I was told that I had to call and ask why the wire wasn't approved as this had to be completed immediately for the 'inside job investigation '. What about me calling and asking why the wire wasn't sent yet, because it was submitted in the morning, is not fraudulent or a major RED FLAG - and why didn't anyone ask me if I was being told to do the wires, etc. - as my total funds are about to be wiped out. No suspicious or unusual activity here as there are now XXXX wires in 3 days wiping out my total account balances. The fraudster kept telling me to not talk to anyone for the inside job investigation as I was continually being threatened and under GREAT DURESS. I would be considered the 3rd party - as the wires are going to the XXXX I was told. 

XXXX, what about the XX/XX/year> phone call from XXXX from XXXX where she said "" After a lot of bad things, I finally have good news as your funds are going to be returned with interest, by hopefully the end of next week '' which would have been XX/XX/year>? Of course, when nothing happened and no funds were returned to me, I called again and the talking points started in again. XXXX, did you review that phone call and who authorized XXXX to say that? Ally Bank only reviews phone calls that support their narrative. In addition, on two separate recorded phone calls ( XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I was told that Ally Bank has XXXX fraud liability if reported in 60 days 'which I have done '. XXXX, have those phone calls been reviewed? 

However, the best 'award winning "" customer service is the phone call I made to Ally Bank XXXX XX/XX/year> -eventually reaching XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the XXXX Department, after XXXX fully verified. I made that phone call on XX/XX/year> between XXXXXXXX XXXX and was extremely upset with my boss sitting at my desk trying to help me when I realized that the first $ XXXX was missing. ( XXXX XXXX told me that the funds were just in a subaccount - and would be merged with the conclusion of the 'inside job investigation '. XXXX wouldn't talk to me because there was a 3rd party with me- and I kept saying that I had fraud on my account. Guess what, XXXX just hung up the phone- when I am desperate to try to tell Ally that I have fraud on my account and that my funds are missing. XXXX, did you review that phone call - for award winning customer care? XXXX, why didn't you include that fact in your email of XX/XX/year>? No one can ead any notes on my account- as apparently award winning customer care doesn't know to put any notes on my account that "" I was a victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and wanted my accounts frozen ''? No wonder fraud happens all of the time as Ally certainly failed in protecting my accounts and funds. 

In closing, the absolute worst information from XXXX is that even though I called Ally Bank on XX/XX/year>, early in the morning, less than 24 hours since the 3rd wire in the amount of {$29000.00} was sent, and eventually talked to XXXX, stating that my funds are gone, I asked that the wires would be recalled. XXXX spent time lecturing me about pronouns when I accidentally called her a him - rather than taking action to get the funds back - as I was once again beyond words and hysterical. I said that I wasn't concerned with a new account as that could be done later. Oh no, the award winning customer service took forever and was finally told that she would recall the wires which led me to believe that would be done immediately. If Ally Bank is on the cutting edge of wire fraud- why did ALLY BANK WAIT 6 MORE DAYS TO RECALL THE WIRES- not until XX/XX/year> per XXXX 's email of XX/XX/year>? We all know that fraudulent wires to fraudulent accounts have the funds wiped out immediately. XXXX states that the recovery of funds from an external financial institution is not guaranteed - but what is guaranteed in that the funds WON'T be recovered in their entirety when Ally Bank waits 6 days to even try to get the funds back. Ally Bank DID NOT protect my funds and does not care about the fact that my funds are gone through all of this inept customer service. XXXX said that fraudsters are aggressive - which is why I called ALLY BANK ON XX/XX/year> and I said that "" I was the victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and I want my accounts frozen '' - BEFORE anything had happened. What Ally returned was my two estimated tax payments that didn't go to the IRS and IL Dept of Revenue and will cause me to incur penalties and related trouble for me, but XXXX states that I unfroze my accounts which is not a true statement. I was told by the representative on XX/XX/year> that I would have to call for each transaction on my account as it would REMAIN FROZEN. Since I have been schooled in 'fraud ' from the XXXX paragraphs in XXXX XXXX email, the second employee unfroze my accounts on XX/XX/year> when the fraudster told me that i had to call to move the {$9400.00} from my savings account to spending account - as the funds had come in fraudulently and would need to be wired to thXXXX XXXX  to try to get the money back to the rightful owners. The fraudsters knew that if i called to move the funds, the accounts would be unfrozen more than likely - because Ally Bank 's employee did not read any warning message on my account- because the first Ally Bank employee on XX/XX/year> apparently never put anything on my accounts. Why else would all of this been missed by any number of employees- especially those supposedly approving wire transactions? Award winning customer service all around because NONE OF THIS IS SUSPICIOUS AND UNUSUAL ACTIVITY to the tune of wiping out my accounts in 3 days for {$54000.00}. Where is the cutting edge technology of Ally Bank to prevent fraud- as stated by XXXX? 

In closing, the slogan of "" We're all better off with an ally '' rings hollow and very untrue. Also, XXXX used the talking point that 'we empathize with any inconvenience this XXXX have caused and appreciate the opportunity to respond to your concern '. XXXX can't be reached so how does one discuss - since I am disputing the truth of her statements- as I don't know if this is the LEGAL RESONSE OF ALLY BANK OR NOT? Then she uses the 'Questions ' call Ally Bank as our award-winning customer care is available 24/7. Not true - as no one will talk to me regarding this issue, as I must continue to deal with XXXX only and now because of the level of angst with this unbelievable situation that has ruined my life- no one will take my call, correct? 

How does one contact your CEO XXXX XXXX XXXX- as it all rises and falls on leadership? 

Is XXXX going to be contacted for me - as I can't reach anyone in XXXX? 

I would like to request a response from someone in ECR or the CEO for all of my issues- as I have been violated, humiliated, embarrassed and have become very angry with all of the untruths from Ally Bank. 

The statements of the email from XXXX that I called and asked for my accounts to be unfrozen was under the information told me on XX/XX/year> - that I would have to call for EACH TRANSACTION - as my accounts would remain frozen ( Case # XXXX ). XXXX, have you listened to that recorded phone call? I NEVER CALLED FOR ANOTHER TRANSFER OF FUNDS- so that is another untrue statement in your email. The $ XXXX transfer was done on my computer without my knowledge- which I have stated about XXXX times. Please review the phone calls. I did not speak to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> to confirm the wire in the amount of {$29000.00} as I believe that the wire department were the ones that called and I merely 'verified "" wire information - as once again, the fraudster initiated the wire, submitted the wire request - and then called me later on to tell me what to say for wire information 'verification '. However, if you say that Customer Care verified the wire information - no wonder they don't know what to ask to verify anything- especially when no one can see the message that "" I am a victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and I want my accounts frozen ''. The {$29000.00} wire is doubly fraudulent - first because I didn't request the wire and secondly, since it contained $ XXXX that was transferred from my spending account to savings account WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION. 

With all due respect, I am exhausted by the total denial of Ally Bank to define fraud, and hide behind XXXX fraud liability - by merely having XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX state that I authorized the wires by selectively cherry pick phone calls- and now XXXX providing an email response to a situation with inaccurate and false statements. Ally Bank should have shut down my accounts immediately on XX/XX/year> and especially on XX/XX/year> when I called Ally Bank and said to XXXX ' that I HAVE FRAUD ON MY ACCOUNT. Ally Bank 's response - no fraud here - too bad. Ally Bank did not protect my accounts and doesn't care to try to recover any funds in a timely manner as well.

Like many Navy Federal Credit Union members, I was dismayed to discover that these overdraft fees had accrued in situations where they appeared to be unjustified, particularly in light of the circumstances detailed in the recent class action lawsuit. 

I have consistently managed my account responsibly and feel that these fees do not reflect fair treatment, nor are they in line with the standards I expect from Navy Federal Credit Union. Based on information from recent settlement proceedings, I believe these fees have caused significant financial inconvenience and undue hardship, which I feel should be addressed both in terms of immediate remedy and in preventing future occurrences. 

Given these concerns, I kindly request the following : Refund or Credit for Past Overdraft Fees : As part of the resolution for this matter, I request a refund or credit for overdraft fees that I believe were unfairly charged to my account. Please provide me with a detailed history of these fees and any options for reimbursement. 

Clarification of Settlement Terms : I would appreciate further clarification on how the terms of the class action settlement apply to my account. Specifically, I would like to know whether I qualify for any relief under this settlement and how I can participate if I am eligible. 

Commitment to Fair Overdraft Practices : I urge Navy Federal Credit Union to review its overdraft policies and ensure they are aligned with transparent and ethical practices. This step would go a long way in restoring the trust of members who have been negatively impacted by these fees. 

Please provide a written response outlining the steps Navy Federal Credit Union will take to address my concerns and any relevant information regarding my eligibility in the ongoing settlement. I am hopeful that Navy Federal Credit Union will take this opportunity to rectify these issues and improve its commitment to fair and transparent banking practices. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

11/8/2024,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/year>, I called Ally Bank and said : "" I am the victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and want my accounts frozen ''. Case # XXXX I was told by the representative that I would have to call for each transaction on my accounts- as they would remain frozen. I did this before anything else had transpired. I believed that representative that my accounts would remain frozen - unless I called to request a specific transaction. No one from ALLY Bank will confirm if this message was ever put on my accounts- and, apparently not, because I have lost all of my money and my accounts did not remain frozen. How else would any representative not read the message and allow XXXX fraudulent wires to be sent out- in addition to a transfer from spending account to savings account in the amount of XXXX? I DID NOT AUTHORIZE this transfer. How would no XXXX suspect ANY suspicious and unusual activity that amounted to {$54000.00} wired out in the matter of XXXX days? I have never wired funds ever and don't know how to - and the balances in my account remained consistent for months. I only called to make XXXX transfer of {$9400.00} from savings to spending at the demand of the fraudulent XXXX from Ally in the beginning of this nightmare - with him always reminding me that this was an inside job and that I couldn't discuss anything with anyone. 

Initially, I was called by the fraudulent 'Alex XXXX Ally ' from Ally 's Fraud Department on a spoofed Ally Bank number - telling me that there were transactions going in and out of my accounts in a very sophisticated manner and Ally Bank needed to investigate because this was the XXXX case like this- with the other XXXX being 'inside jobs '. I was told to transfer the {$9400.00} from savings to spending because they were going to try to get the funds back to the defrauded individuals by sending the wires to the XXXX 

Today, I received an email from XXXX for the XXXX Customer Relations which I have attached. In the last paragraph of the email I was told that if I had any questions I just needed to call Ally Bank. XXXX, as with the many other escalation employees at Ally Bank, do not leave their contact information and I was on hold for XXXX hour and XXXX minutes - never able to talk to anyone from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. There are numerous false statements in her email- let alone the fact that the first XXXX paragraphs tell me how to be aware of fraud. I called on XX/XX/year> and TOLD ALLY BANK that I was a victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and wanted my accounts frozen. I did what I could but Ally Bank did not protect my accounts or my funds- and their employees are untrained and can't read that I asked for my accounts to be frozen. Apparently, only XXXX employee understands that if an account is to be frozen that it is for XXXX transaction without approval and unfortunately that was the initial employee on XX/XX/year> only- before anything had happened. XXXX only says that I wanted a 'restriction ' - when I had said that I was a victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and want my accounts frozen. Big difference. At the fraudster 's request, I was told that I had to transfer {$9400.00} from savings to spending - and my accounts should have remained frozen. 

XXXX states that on XX/XX/year>, Ally Bank received XXXX outgoing wire transfer request via AOS from my savings account. I have stated a XXXX times that the fraudsters were on my computer with the screen locked as I was threatened that if I got on my accounts that I would be considered a XXXX party in their 'inside job ' investigation. I was constantly reminded that I couldn't speak to anyone. If it is an 'inside job ' - what could I say to anyone from Ally Bank XXXX as it is a money laundering scheme. Why wouldn't anyone from Ally Bank read the message on my account and protect my funds? Why couldn't anyone from Ally Bank recognize the unusual and suspicious activity? I have NO IDEA what XXXX is- as I did not request any of the wires, submit any of the wire forms or whatever happens- and I merely 'verified "" wire information that was told to me by the fraudster - threatening me to not say anything in order to complete their investigation of the inside job. XXXX states that the {$9400.00} and {$15000.00} wires went to XXXX XXXX. Not true- but when I was asked to verify the wire for {$9400.00} - I was asked for the bank name. I said - I don't have the bank name - only the account information. Why wouldn't anyone in the wire department recognize that if I didn't even know the bank name that should have been a major red flag - especially since I had said I am a victim of identity theft and a money laundering scheme and want my accounts frozen. On XX/XX/year>, I did call Ally Bank because I received an email from the IRS that my estimated tax payment had been returned. I was so angry because that is a requirement to be posted to my account- or I will have a penalty. The same thing happened with my automatic debit to the XXXX Department of Revenue- as both payments were returned for estimated tax payments. I was informed by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> that the accounts were now unfrozen and I said that I wanted those XXXX payments to go- but too late. XXXX states that I confirmed that I said that I had wanted the wires to go- which is what was perhaps said under great duress from the fraudster who had initiated the wires, submitted the wires and I merely confirmed wire information - because of the threatening of the fraudster who was on my computer doing all of this with the screen locked. XXXX leaves out a very important fact - that on XX/XX/year> I called Ally Bank between XXXX am and finally got to the Fraud Department XXXX after I realized that my accounts were missing the approx $ XXXX ( first XXXX wires ). My boss was sitting at my desk and when we finally got 'XXXX XXXX of Ally Bank XXXX XXXX department XXXX the line, XXXX wouldn't talk because I had my boss, XXXX XXXX speaking as well as myself on my cell phone ( on speaker ). I kept saying that I had fraud on my account and was upset - as XXXX said to calm down and we tried to talk to XXXX about the situation. XXXX kept saying that she couldn't talk to me because a XXXX party was on the line and HUNG UP ON ME. TRIED TO REPORT FRAUD. In the closing sentence of the email from XXXX she states that Ally Bank has award-winning customer care. Had XXXX shown ANY award-winning customer care, the remainder of my funds might have stayed 'intact. However, fraudulent XXXX from Ally immediately called and said that there wasn't a problem at all and he transferred me to XXXX XXXX - cohort in crime and the rest is history. I tried to inform Ally Bank of the fraud- under extreme duress and continuing threats- but no one could read a message that should have been on my account- as well as the 'suspicious and unusual activity that has wiped out my funds. Before the XXXX wire in the amount of {$29000.00} was sent I had a call from Ally Bank asking if I had made a transfer of $ XXXX. I said "" XXXX, I will have to call you back ''. If Ally Bank is constantly protecting accounts and watching for fraud - what about that phone call? Why are none of the recorded phone calls that I have asked about show no fraud or suspicious transactions. XXXX states that 'Additionally, I requested to have the restriction removed from my spending account in order to make another transfer. '' THAT IS NOT TRUE - as the ONLY call I made to make a transfer was the initial {$9400.00} from savings to spending. When did I call - and what amount did I request? When I don't answer the representative whether I made a transfer of XXXX - with XXXX, I will have to call you back and never did - no fraud? I NEVER authorized that transfer because I didn't even know about it - as they WERE ON MY COMPUTER requesting the wires, submitting the wires, transferring funds- and I merely 'verified "" the wire information as told to me by the fraudsters- as the money is going to the BBB under great duress. There was another phone XXXX from Ally Bank ( women ) on the XXXX as well - asking if I have an XXXX and a XXXX Computer - and I answered 'yes ' since that is what I have. Apparently, that VERIFIES something according to ALLY BANK. Did you listen to the phone call? For the XXXX wire, I was told by fraudster that I had to call Ally Bank and find out why the wire hadn't gone out even though the fraudsters has requested the wire in the morning and by the wire cutoff time of XXXX XXXX that wire had not been verified. No suspicious activity with me calling asking why the wire hadn't been sent. Why wouldn't Ally Bank tell me that they suspected fraud - but wait - I HAD CALLED IN AN SAID I WAS THE VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT AND A MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEME AND WANTED MY ACCOUNTS FROZEN. What was the wire department looking for - as nothing suspicious with XXXX wires in XXXX  days wiping out all of my funds? XXXX states that I spoke to XXXX XXXX to confirm wires - as I had no idea who called - but why wouldn't a representative from the Wire Department call to verify wire information?

If nothing is fraudulent - then Ally Bank has no liability.

11/22/2024,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,I recently obtained a mortgage with PenFed end of XX/XX/year>. In XXXX we thought we had set up auto pay to start with the XXXX payment. In XXXX I received an alert saying I was 30 days late from XXXX XXXX. We called in to find out why payment did not pull and were told we did not set up autopay. At this time my husband requested this be looked into and we made the payments to bring account current. He did not receive a call back so I then called in. I let the person know we have not received any statements. It has been confirmed the address in the loan system was set up wrong. The closing paperwork did have a correct mailing address that we were using. In addition we were told that PenFed did try to call but did NOT leave voicemail messages so we had no idea that there was an issue. The number that they call from does not indicate PenFed so we had no idea they were calling or it would have alerted me to an issue. In addition they indicated they did not have my contact number which I find strange since I can see it on the final application paperwork. Customer Service is now saying on XXXX we made a 1 time payment and then setup auto pay and then deleted autopay at the same time which does not seem correct or was an system error. If we had received any statements I would have known my payment was missed and made it prior to the 30 day late which has now impacted my credit greatly. We had also prior to the XXXX payment had the address updated but it was only updated in the retail side. We were not told until recently that you have to contact each department to update information. Customer service spoke with collections who has indicated that they will not change the reporting. Based on the fact that the company had information to reach me and provide a monthly statement I feel like PenFed contributed to my payment being late. I pulled up my final loan paperwork and show the mailing address was not the physical address and my phone number was on final loan application. PenFed would have received this paperwork from the escrow company prior to my loan funding. I am trying to work with customer service to get this resolved but have now been told 4 times that they will not fix this. I feel this is poor customer service and that they did not meet the requirement to send me my mortgage statement monthly.

'' XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, being consumer reporting agencies, are bound by this statutory duty, and I, as the Sovereign Consumer, command that my private information be protected, as upheld by XXXX5 USC 6801, which declares, "" It is the policy of Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information. '' The financial institutions that furnish information to these credit reporting agencies fall under this obligation by definition. Furthermore, 15 USC 1681 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) explicitly states : "" No consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report except in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. '' I hereby affirm that no such written instructions have been provided by me to XXXX, XXXX, or any furnisher of information, and any alleged consent, whether verbal, non-verbal, implied, or otherwise, is unequivocally revoked. 

Additionally, pursuant to 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ), "" A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. '' I have never been informed of this right by the furnishers of information. This failure constitutes a blatant violation of federal law.

Moreover, 15 USC 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) mandates that no consumer reporting agency may include in its reports adverse information predating seven years, except for criminal convictions. Yet, these agencies continue to unlawfully report adverse items without my consent, flouting legal boundaries.

The furnishers of this information are further restrained by 15 USC 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which forbids the transmission of any information that is inaccurate or that they have reason to believe is inaccurate. Similarly, 15 USC 1681e commands all consumer reporting agencies to maintain procedures that prevent such violations. XXXX and XXXX have failed in this regard, disregarding the statutes that bind them.

Finally, under 12 CFR 1016.7, I exercise my unalienable right to opt out of these reporting services at my discretion and at any time. As of this declaration, I am opting out.

Let this serve as an authoritative decree : my rights as the Sovereign Consumer shall not be infringed. All parties are hereby noticed of their violations and compelled to cease and desist from further unauthorized reporting or sharing of my information.

11/7/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"US Bank has assessed an unknown amount of fees on an account after the account holder 's death. They refuse to provide details about the account or refund the fees. 

My father was a US Bank checking account holder. He passed away unexpectedly on XX/XX/XXXX. Needless to say, I was very devastated. I contacted US Bank following my father 's passing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was asked to provide my father 's death certificate as well as my personal information to establish I am next of kin. I provided all of those items. 

US Bank then advised that Missouri requires a small estate affidavit to release the account. 
I contacted a probate attorney in Missouri who advised me that I needed the account number and balance to provide to the Court ( they need to verify the account and amount to ensure statutory compliance for small estates ). 
I was refused the account number by US Bank on claimed legal grounds, but never provided grounds outside of "" policy ''. 
My attorney then advised that I was required to wait for the creditor claim window to close if I could not provide the account details. 

We waited until that window closed to file the petition with the Court. 

I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX from US Bank indicating that they were charging "" dormancy fees '' on the account. 

My attorney filed the probate petition in XXXX and I received the affidavit of XXXXourt allowing the funds to transfer on XX/XX/XXXX. 

After the petition was filed, I emailed U.S. Bank on XX/XX/XXXX to alert them the petition was able to be filed and request someone to address these fees on the account. I did not receive any response. 

My father 's account started at a balance of {$8100.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. 
As of XX/XX/XXXX, the balance was {$7600.00}. 
As of XX/XX/XXXX, the balance was {$7400.00}. 
As of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX, the balance was {$7300.00}. 

I have requested a daily accounting of the account and a refund of any fees assessed by U.S. Bank. They refused to provide me any other account details, so if any auto-withdrawals were being taken following his death, I do not know and could not stop them. I requested dormancy fees be refunded, as it was US Bank 's own policies that prevented me from initiating "" customer activity '' on the account. 

I requested all internal policies as well as legal bases for denying me the account I am unclear as to what was withdrawn from my father 's account following his death. They refuse to refund the fees, and refuse to cooperate to provide account details. They stated, contrary to any legal authority I could find, I was required to open a full probate estate.

11/4/2024,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Hello, I am a XXXX veteran and my wife and I originally had out home loan through XXXX XXXX. In less than 2 months we were notified out of the blue that NewRez would be taking over our home loan which we did not want because my wife and I never heard of them and they had REALLY bad reviews on XXXX but we did not have a choice. I now see why!! I am a XXXX & XXXX veteran so I receive a discounted rate on property taxes through the state of MN due to me being XXXX. I went though my county assessors when buying the house and they reviewed my XXXX paperwork and changed the amount I should be paying to escrow each month. 

After they reviewed everything they sent all the required documentation over to NewRez to change the monthly property tax amount/escrow I should be paying since its built in. I noticed after almost a year nothing changed so I reached out to my assessors office and informed them nothing has changed and they then tall me they never got a response which has never happened before .... of course my luck! 

They instructed me to try and get a hold of NewRez and inquire on what's going on and why they haven't changed my rate or reimbursed me. This whole process took multiple months, I called multiple times but they have such long wait times through customer service and no callback which made it difficult a even get a hold of someone cause waiting over an hour on the phone is ridiculous. I could go on and on about that whole process in itself. 

But after a year I finally got the monthly rate/escrow changed even though it was an absolute headache but I was happy it got done and changed. I then told them that I have been over paying them by {$400.00} a month for now like 15 months and that needs to be reimbursed to me since I should never have been paying that in the first place. 

I showed all the proof and dates of receipts and they told me they would start a claim for the reimbursement part of it. Well we are now at another over XXXX months since then and XXXX claims later and not one response/call back or email. 

When I call I and actually get a hold of someone the service representative has no idea how the veteran/escrow process works and just state they are going to notate the account and that they can not put me in hold with someone from that dept. I tell them no I need to speak to someone but in the end they just start a claim with the escrow department. 

This has been an absolute nightmare and after talking to my other XXXX vet buddies I am completely alone and they have never had an issue with this before. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with and are so disorganized on so many different levels. I have now filed complaints with XXXX  and other sources and was informed to make a claim on this site. 

I really need a third party to help me out because I am unprepared on how to go about this since it is my first mortgage and this feels extremely illegal. I dont want to go the lawyer route since then I will just pay lawyer fees and loose money in the end.

11/14/2024,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Loan sold or transferred to another company,"I originally purchased a car using Bank of the West as the lender. At some point the loan was sold to BMO Bank. I did not know this until BMO Bank called telling me that they needed a payoff amount of {$1700.00} immediately or they would start reporting delinquent notices to my credit report. My payments have been {$550.00} for the term of the loan. I explained to BMO Bank that at the beginning of XXXX, Bank of the West called me and offered to defer payments for 3 months due to mass layoffs. My wife and I had just been laid off so I had them explain how the deferment would work. It was explained to me that if I took advantage of the deferment offer that it would extend my loan term by the amounts of months that I deferred payments for however it would not affect my loan amount or interest paid. I accepted the offer to help due to the strain of my wife and I both being laid off and my new payoff date would be extended 3 months. When I explained this to the customer service representative for BMO, they told me that it was 4 months but they had no record of it so I would have to pay the full amount. I told them that was not the agreement and that I would need to speak to someone that can help me resolve this issue. They put me in touch with a gentleman named Irony. He listened and said he would take my problem to the proper people and get back with me in what was 3 days. When he called me back, he said that they couldn't find the deferment paperwork and they wanted me to send them the deferment paperwork and loan contract. I didnt understand this since they told me that it wasnt 3 months like I thought but it was 4 months. Yet they know nothing about the deferment? Also when Irony told me that it would be 3 days before he could get back to me, I asked if they would be reporting any delinquency to the credit reporting agencies. He told me that he couldnt guarantee that they wouldnt but I could just have them remove it if it came to that. That seemed completely unreasonable and I now had no faith that they were willing and/or capable of holding up any bargain or contract so I chose to just take on the financial hardship and pay off the loan amount seeing as how I didnt feel I should be responsible for Bank of the West or BMO Banks purchasing/selling my loan. I had never been late on a payment ( automatic payments ) and I dont understand how this type of thing happens. I held up my end of the loan and BMO seemed to not want to honor the loan that they purchased. I feel deceived and taken advantage of by BMO Bank and this has caused significant financial hardship on my family due to no actions by me. There needs to be some accountability from BMO Bank to understand the loans in which they are purchasing. To force this upon me, although I had nothing to do with their transaction, is inexcusable. I will be speaking with legal representation due to the unnecessary hardship BMO Bank is forcing onto me and Im sure other customers due to no fault of the customer.

In the past Ive spent money for him to play games on his XXXX account but never more than XXXX or so at a time and they always be spaced out. He took it upon himself to steal my card without me knowing and spend all the money on it. As soon as I found this out I called the bank immediately and they said theyd be filing a claim. My XXXX main issues are how can someone spend {$770.00} within a XXXX hour period on the same service and I dont get a single sms or email asking if I approve the transaction. I dont ever spend that type of money in XXXX sitting. The only way I was even able to find out was when I got a notification that the card was declined and then from there I checked the account and moved forward. Companies need to be held accountable for their negligence as at XXXX point he stole {$400.00} in XXXX sitting from my account and I didnt get a single sms, email, or anything to verify the transaction. My second issue is how can my card be maxed out essentially under the account he uses for his games which is not under my name. I contacted XXXX and was told that they couldnt help me directly because my card was used under an account that isnt in my name. This makes no sense to me as you can use the card and take the money out of my account when it isnt in my name but when it comes to helping me rectify fraudulent transactions now you can no longer help me. Another complaint I have is shouldnt the bank be able to see XXXX not older than the legal age to gamble and reach out when over {$770.00} is taken within a XXXX hour window to ask if these are fraudulent or not. Sunday XX/XX/year> at XXXX PM EST {$160.00} was taken, {$160.00} was taken out again at XXXX PM EST, {$400.00} was taken at XXXX PM EST, and {$50.00} was taken at XXXX PM EST.

I maintained a balance of {$5000.00} within the first few days of opening the account, which should have satisfied the requirements to avoid the fee. Despite this, the fee was charged, prompting me to call and request that it be waived. 

When I called the business banking department, the representative was extremely rude, argumentative, and condescending. They repeatedly asked for identifying information, including both my business and personal checking account numbers, and made me repeat myself multiple times unnecessarily. This prolonged the call and added to my frustration. The representative then lectured me in a condescending tone, argued with my responses, and ultimately hung up on me without resolving my issue. 

I then called Citibank 's main customer service line and asked to speak with a business banking specialist. The representative claimed they could assist me, but it became clear they were not equipped to handle my concern. After keeping me on the phone for approximately 30 minutes, they also hung up on me without providing any resolution.

I advised the rep at select portfolio mortgage company, that I didn't want to do this. If it was going to take a while or XXXX things up. He assured me that it wouldn't. They asked me to send in all my financial information which I did. They asked me to send in my pay stubs which I did. I let them know that my pay was going to be a little bit lower so it was going to be hard for me to make that payment for just that month.

I have been making payments every month still. But the payments were hold in an "" unapplied fund '' account while my bankruptcy was active. And on XX/XX/XXXX, the payments for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX were finally applied to my account balance. And the ending balance was {$31000.00}. 

And for the XXXX payment, I made an payment online from my shellpoint account portal. And this payment was withdrew from my XXXX XXXX checking account on XX/XX/XXXX with the following description : XX/XX/XXXX - Withdrawl from NEWREZ-SHELLPOINT WEBPMTS ( - {$1000.00} ). But then around XX/XX/XXXX I tried to make the payment for the XXXX due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I noticed my XX/XX/XXXX payment ( fund already taken out of my XXXX  account ) were never applied to my HELOC account balance. Shellpoint 's agent told me they never saw this payment in my payment history. So, I called XXXX  XXXX to reverse the XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. This is how it's displayed in the bank statement XX/XX/XXXX - Withdrawal from NEWREZ-SHELLPOINT WEB PMTS Reversal Effective XX/XX/XXXX. I then call the bank and made the payment with the help of their agent and it's posted on my bank on XX/XX/XXXX. It's display as the following on my bank statement : XX/XX/XXXX - withdrawal from NEWREZ-SHELLPOINT ACH PMT ( - {$1000.00} ). So, I thought this will cover my XXXX payment and for sure my HELOC balance should be now lower. So, around XX/XX/XXXX, I logged on to my account and found that the XX/XX/XXXX payment were never received and my balance has grown because they said since I had reversed the XX/XX/XXXX payment. So, I filed a complaint to correct the accounting error. And made the XXXX payment on the phone with the help of an agent. This was posted on my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. It was displayed as this on my bank statement : XX/XX/XXXX - Withdrawal from NEWREZ-SHELLPOINT ACH PMT ( - {$1000.00} ). Then around XX/XX/XXXX, I called the agent to see if the accounting error with the wrong balance has been resolved. They said still pending. And They did not see my XX/XX/XXXX payment, nor the XX/XX/XXXX payment. So, that's when I said that's it. this is getting too crazy. I am going to have my bank reverse those two payments since you said you never received them, yet the funds were already withdrawn from my checking account. So, I called XXXX XXXX to reverse the payments for XX/XX/XXXX and the XX/XX/XXXX. They appeared on the statement as follows : XX/XX/XXXX - Withdraw from NEWREZ-SHELLPOINT ACH PMT REVERSAL Effective : XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - Withdraw from NEWREZ-SHELLPOINT ACH PMT REVERSAL Effective : XX/XX/XXXX. And then now they said although they can't see the payment that has been withdrawn from my account ( taken out of my checking account ), but they can see payments that have been reversed. So, now they are saying I still owe them for the XXXX payment as well. ( because I reversed the payment that they never received ). I provided them with my bank statement showing them that I have made three payments to them on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. And I have reversed these three payments on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX So, that should prove that my balance should stay the same {$31000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX when the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX payments were applied. And I only owe XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments. I have filed support tickets and have provided the my bank statement to prove that. But I never gotten any confirmation or follow up. And when I called again today and the agent said no they don't go by my bank statement. They go by their accounting system. And that I still owe them {$32000.00}. And I still owe them XXXX, XXXX, XXXX And XXXX payments. 

This is insane. Please investigate this shady company please. I am at wits end. We need help proving that they did received my payments.

On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a new complaint to Shellpoint mortgage services and mentioned in that complaint that it was not a similar complaint and provided additional documentation as to the errors on my credit report. The correspondence attached is Shellpoint in writing stating they made a mistake but also stating they found no errors. This is contradictory.

I also did not receive a call providing this information. Your instructions state on your website to submit a request for extension. My attachment proves I did in fact do that. I requested that Shellpoint provide the outbound call log of attempts made by their loss mitigation team. They didnt provide and further confirms they did follow their written protocol as it relates to loss mitigation process. 

I also raised in my XX/XX/XXXX complaint they updated my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX as delinquent instead of the true status of in forbearance. If my account was in forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX was as of today my credit report dated XX/XX/XXXX indicates I am not in forbearance but delinquent as of XX/XX/XXXX. This is is indeed an error.

I knew it could possibly be a complex issue with my out of state drivers license, it being a new account and the amount I understood what the process would be. When I went to teller I explained to her the situation and the amount of the check. I explained to her that I wanted to DEPOSIT it in my account. I told her I knew the process of holding the check to verify it and I am okay with that, whatever the time limit would be is fine. She ran my check thru the machine and stated they needed to call to verify it. I told her that was totally fine. The manager comes out to look at the check. Im explaining to her the same thing and she barely engaged with me, she wasnt welcoming at all. I had the feeling of discrimination. However I went against my gut. I waited for over 15 mins just to be told no one is picking up and they can not deposit my check. Im thinking the time of day maybe the verification team is on lunch. I came the next day right when they opened thinking its early and someone will answer when they call to verify it. Again the same teller that helped me the day prior said they would have to call to verify it Im like thats fine. She goes in the back 10 mins later she tells me no one is picking up. Im like really. I tried two other branches the XXXX XXXX XXXX by the XXXX XXXX and the one off XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I was treated the same I feel the manager at the XXXX XXXX branch flagged my account about the check I was trying to deposit. Yes I understand its a new account with no activity as well as the DL and the amount. However my account is open I have a legit DL and the check is legit. So why did yall make it so impossible to DEPOSIT a check that was written out to ME with my account in my name and hold the check until its verified?? Its fine though I got it handled.

11/11/2024,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Unable to receive car title or other problem after the loan is paid off,"I have a complaint against Central  Bank located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, MO XXXX, in which I have outlined below. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I opened auto loan with Central Bank in the amount of {$19000.00} for a term of 72 months ( six years ) with the monthly payment to be {$310.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : Every month I faithfully paid my monthly payment of {$310.00} via the online bank site XXXX of XXXX : I missed making my standard car payment in the month of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : I resumed making my monthly car payment of {$310.00} online XX/XX/XXXX : I began trying to pay off all outstanding debts to include this auto loan. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I accessed the online banking site to review my loan balance, which revealed the balance to be {$4000.00}, and I went ahead and made a {$3000.00} payment online. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I proceeded to make an additional payment in the amount of {$1000.00} through the online site. 

Month of XX/XX/XXXX : Payments that I made in the month of XX/XX/XXXX totaled {$4000.00}. After payments, the online site reflected that the remaining balance of the loan was a total of {$400.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I made my regular loan payment of {$310.00} online XX/XX/XXXX : I went online to pay the remaining balance of my loan, in which the site reflected the remaining balance to be {$93.00}, in which I paid {$93.00} to satisfy the loan. 

The Next Several Months : With the loan paid in full, I awaited the lien release to arrive in the mail. I planned to keep my vehicle, therefore there was no urgency in receiving the lien release. 

A Saturday, between the end of XX/XX/XXXX and the end of XX/XX/XXXX : With months passing since I paid the last payment, I called the bank to question the status of the lien release. Due to it being the weekend, the only information I could obtain was the name of a supervisor of whom I should call and speak with during the week. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I became aware of derogatory remarks on my credit report that were negatively affecting my credit score and found the impact was from my auto loan with Central Bank. 

Concerned with the negative impact to my credit score, I attempted accessing my loan information online, just as I had done when making my payments online ; however, the bank had deactivated my online account, and I was unable to view any information. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called Central Bank and asked to speak to XXXX, who was the supervisor that I had been referred to in my earlier call. Unfortunately, I never thought to obtain XXXX last name ; however, to my knowledge she is still employed with Central Bank. 

My phone conversation with XXXX on this particular day, consisted of me explaining all the details which are outlined above and up to this point. XXXX stated that she needed to review the details of my account, and that she would return my phone call within a few business days. 

Mid-XXXX  XXXX : I had not received a call back from XXXX as promised, therefore I decided I would call to follow up with her. XXXX stated she had reviewed my account and though I might have paid the remaining balance of my loan showing online, the online balance did not include the late fees on my loan. I was then informed that late fees had been assessed to my account from the time of my missed payment in XXXX of XXXX through XXXX of XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, Central Bank charged off my account as a Profit and loss write-off and reported this to the credit reporting bureaus. 

When asking why the payments in XXXX of XXXX, which totaled {$4000.00} did not cover any outstanding late fee ( s ), I was told that this would have required me providing specific instruction to the bank. Though the {$4000.00} payment exceeded my monthly loan payment of {$310.00}, the bank did not put any of the payment towards the prior late fees and left them outstanding. 

XXXX offered to remove two of the late fees assessed, but claimed there was nothing more she could do, and said that I should have called the bank for a pay off balance. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called Central Bank and spoke with XXXX XXXX, who was the Vice President/Consumer Loan Office, and we went over the same material that is outlined throughout this complaint. At the end of our conversation, I received the same exact response that I had received from XXXX, in the call documented above. 

Since I was unable to access my account information online, I requested that XXXX XXXX provide me with a full statement of my loan activity, in which she mailed to me and is attached hereto. 

The account activity confirms that from XXXX of XXXX through XXXX of XXXX, that XXXX of XXXX was the only month during the entire loan that a monthly payment was not made. 

Needless to say, I was highly upset as the bank and I both agreed that the auto loan of {$19000.00} was paid in full, but the bank claimed I had not paid the account in full, due to the assessed late fees. 

What is more upsetting is that Central Bank reported this loan as a charge off and a Profit and Loss Write-Off to the credit reporting bureaus, which is and has been damaging to my credit. The bank refuses to release the lien on my vehicle, and to this day, late payments continue to be reported to the credit reporting bureaus. 

So what has happened is Central Bank was assessing late fees on late fees. Is this legal, because I don't believe it is? 

XX/XX/XXXX : After reviewing the statement of my loan activity, I personally went to Central Bank and spoke directly to XXXX XXXX, in attempt to work out a resolution ; however, I got no further on XX/XX/XXXX, then I did in my previous phone conversations with the bank, which is the reason why I am now turning to your agency. 

Additional Upsetting Factors to Resolve : From XXXX of XXXX, when the auto loan was opened through the end of XXXX, I never communicated in person or via the phone with Central Bank. All loan payments were paid online and I always retrieved my account activity online as well. Therefore, when the online site listed the remaining balance of the loan as {$93.00}, I assumed that was the "" actual '' balance of loan. I paid the {$93.00} and assumed the loan was satisfied in full. 

Central Banks online site allowed me to successfully pay the remaining balance of {$93.00} and did not provide any obvious online instructions that directed me to call the bank for a pay-off amount. 

The printed statement of my account activity, in which Central Bank provided to me reveals that my {$4000.00} loan payment in XXXX of XXXX was not substantial enough to cover late fee ( s ) previously assessed to my account. The account activity also reflects that after I paid the actual loan in full, the bank continued to assess {$10.00} late fees up to the time the bank reported my account as charged off and a Profit and Loss Write-Off. 

Upon review of my credit report, which is attached hereto, you will see that the bank is reporting 15 late payments, beginning in XXXX of XXXX, the date of my last online payment of {$93.00}. 

The 15 late payments reported by Central Bank and are shown reported from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, showing that only 81 % of payments to be made on time. This has impacted my credit in such a way, that I can not even obtain a credit card.

[WITHOUT PREJUDICE]
URGENCY: HIGH
IMPORTANCE: HIGH
This is to complain against U. S. Bank.
U. S. Bank account ending in: XXXX
I wish to practice my right as a customer of U. S. Bank to use your organisation's service, seeking a
formal, impartial investigation to amicably settle my dispute with U. S. Bank.
In order to clear up the myriad of letters and correspondences I have hitherto sent to U. S. Bank
respecting my complaint, I believe it will substantially strengthen both my case and your understanding,
by taking a deeper look at the happenings of my case, and analysing the relevant facts in an objective and
comprehensive fashion.
It is crucial to note that I have been manipulated, socially-engineered and coerced to engage these
fraudulent criminals. Much to my embarrassment, I recognise that I am the victim of an investment scam.
My complaint to the CFPB has arisen as I do not consider, by any stretch of the imagination, the conduct
of U. S. Bank to be commensurate with their legal role and responsibility to their customers. They sell a
service to look after their customers, protect their money and are a financial institution that maintains a
traditional relationship and way of working with its customers.
During the complaints process with U. S. Bank, I found their communication ineffective, which further
hides their conduct to management and diminishes the service offering to their clients. They are
struggling to adapt their business offering in the ever-changing world of IT development. The internet is
presenting a real problem which they choose to manage in a way which is not in line with rules and
regulations of CFPB as well as their own internal policy and procedures sold to their clients.
General Obligation:
Commencing on or about XXXX  2024, I fell victim to a multi-layered scam operations run by DML Markets under the domain m.dml-markets.cc which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX  USD from my U. S. Bank account to fraudulent investment firm(s).
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability; common queries
include, but are not limited to, the following (i) whether U. S. Bank did not take notice of any rule, law, or
regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that
may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety; (ii) whether by virtue of U. S. Banks
Page XXXX of XXXX
XX/XX/2024
custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so,
whether that duty was breached; (iii) whether U. S. Bank promoted the transaction(s) in question despite
being aware of the nature of the transaction(s) in question (iv) whether U. S. Bank was in compliance
with its own policies and procedures; (v) whether U. S. Bank owed duties to myself, what the scope of
those duties was, and whether U. S. Bank did not uphold those duties; (vi) whether U. S. Banks conduct
was unfair; and (vii) whether U. S. Bank has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me
for the harm that has befallen me.
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member
adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent
and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant
criteria of fraud.
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and
skill of a diligent, prudent banker. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not
turn a blind eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In
other words, U. S. Bank must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real
possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have
known that I was dealing with a scammer.
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a
sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective
element.
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not
average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is
reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of
the evidence suggests that U. S. Bank did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious
dangers in this respect.
Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the
standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the
past.
U. S. Banks Position:
OnXX/XX/2024 U. S. Bank wrote in a letter We regret any frustration or inconvenience this matter
may have caused you. We understand that being the victim of a scam can be confusing, time consuming,
and inconvenient.
Upon receiving your request for assistance, our records confirm two claims were opened with our Wire
Department on XXXX XXXX which debited your account ending XXXX  on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in the amounts
of XXXX and XXXX  A request was sent to the beneficiary bank for recall of these funds.
Please know, the receiving institution is not obligated to return these funds or respond to our request. The
elapsed time from the time of the transfers to the time of the claim submission limits the chances of
recalling the funds. We recommend you also continue working directly with your local law enforcement
officials to attempt to recover your money from the beneficiary of this payment.
Page XXXX of XXXX
XX/XX/2024Refuting U. S. Banks arguments from a purely logical perspective:
U. S. Banks position is that the features of the situation at hand do not generate a genuine obligation to
protect innocent and helpless victims; they are essentially arguing that common-sense-based approaches
are doomed to fail, leaving their exclusively technical account of the subject matter as the only
meaningful choice. For reasons which are unclear, this extremely serious situation barely gets the
attention it deserves even though ample evidence has been offered in support of this complaint.
In U. S. Banks view, it is implied that we should not home in (and consequently rely) on unwritten laws,
practicality, good judgement, reasonableness, sharpness, sensibleness, past outcomes, and insight, when
taking appropriate precautions. To underscore, once again, such views are at odds with common sense
and are wildly irresponsible.
Imagine a view according to which the one and only thing that can make U. S. Bank morally obligated to
do something is having it written down somewhere. Pursuant to this view, if U. S. Bank encounter the
suffering of totally naive victims, they are only obligated to intervene in or remedy the situation, to the
degree required by written material. This is unbecoming for a reputable establishment such as U. S. Bank.
I have reviewed the material hereto sent by U. S. Bank carefully, and it unfortunately provides no
response to my fundamental argument concerning the degree of care. Given its size, influence, and the
resources at its disposal, this establishment clearly had a far greater capacity than an individual such as
myself had, to determine the level and likelihood of risk that a client such as myself is subjected to and
had a duty to intervene as they now do to query in particular out-of-pattern transactions of this kind.
It is perfectly obvious that U. S. Bank, inadvertently, employs a subtle approach in addressing some of the
key questions in a manner which neither provides me with adequate support nor protects anything other
than its own interests.
It is U. S. Bank here, who has the burden of proof, to show that it has exercised the duty of care, that is to
say, that U. S. Bank adhered to a standard of reasonable care in relation to the matter at issue given its
extensive experience compared to mine. It is U. S. Bank that claims that the damages which I have
suffered in connection to this matter have not been reasonably foreseeable, and that my proposed degree
of care is not, and has not been, commensurate with U. S. Banks capacity, experience, expertise, or scope
of services in any way. To reemphasize, U. S. Banks indisputable overriding purpose is by no means to
purely execute transactions in a blind and blank fashion, but rather to strike a balance between executing
those transactions and capitalising on its undeniably vast capabilities to protect consumers thereby
enhancing market integrity.
Apropos of the fluidity of the concept of reasonableness, all U. S. Bank has done in this regard is set up a
dichotomy of having or not having the legal obligation under consideration, however, that does not go
one-inch toward explaining why various regulatory authorities, has maintained that financial institutions
can, and should, protect consumers using their systems, advanced technologies, and rich experience.
U. S. Bank is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may
be being perpetuated. If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam
with the customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is:
 particularly vulnerable, or
Page XXXX of XXXX  XX/XX/2024
 if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected.
There are some recommendations to organisations for protecting customers from financial harm that
might occur as a result of fraud or financial abuse; and gives guidance on how to recognise customers
who might be at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary
actions to prevent or minimise financial harm.
These recommendations are established as a general principle, the organisation should deliver a
service that:
XXXX) Takes a proactive approach to minimising risks, impact and incidences of financial harm and it
sets out systems and tools for the prevention and detection of fraud and financial abuse. As a general
point, it says organisations should ensure that all systems are developed using technologies and
methodologies that are effective in the prevention of fraud and financial abuse, through authorised
and unauthorised payments, thereby minimising the risk of financial harm to customers. As regards to
the detection of fraud and financial abuse, it says the organisation:
A) should have measures in place across all payment channels and products to detect suspicious
transactions or activities that might indicate fraud or financial abuse. It then lists the following
examples of suspicious activity on customer accounts:
a. multiple cheque books;
b. sudden increased spending;
c. transfers to other accounts;
d. multiple password attempts;
e. logins from new devices, multiple geographical locations;
f. sudden changes to the operation of the account; Unusual transactions are
transactions whose amount, characteristics and frequency bear no relation to the
economic activity of the customer, exceed normal market parameters or have no
apparent legal justification.
g. a withdrawal or payment for a large amount;
h. a payment or series of payments to a new payee;
i. financial activity that matches a known method of fraud or financial abuse.
B) organisations should have a process in place to ensure that staff make contact with the
customer to verify the financial activity, challenge its authenticity, explain the nature of the
suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of action.
U. S. Bank are yet to show, or otherwise provide me with, a compelling argument that their wide-ranging
experience and wealth of specialist knowledge in detecting transactional anomalies were not sufficient to
avert the fraud at issue. By contrast, I have provided a multitude of sound and powerful reasons by which
Page XXXX of XXXX
XX/XX/2024requiring their involvement has not only been pressingly relevant but also eminently reasonable and well-
justified.
Rather than empathising with and undertaking substantial efforts to convey their knowledge of the
existence of such regulations abroad and thereafter use it to protect and proactively relieve the plight of
consumers who have been cheated out of their money and whose role in society is properly fulfilled,
positively contributing to local economic growth, development and sustainability  U. S. Bank adopts a
rather insouciant attitude toward my financial predicament portrayed herein.
I am deeply convinced that the disastrous results that I have previously elaborated upon will continue to
ensue if no responsibility is adopted by U. S. Bank in relation to this matter. I have also thoroughly
detailed why they cannot simply dismiss this problem by strictly adhering to legal technicalities which,
after careful reflection, struck me as being nothing more than self-interest. Indeed, it seems to me utterly
unfair to disregard fragile, sensitive, and vulnerable consumers who are afflicted by such allegedly
malevolent acts, thereby keeping an unjust status-quo that is corrupting our society at its core.
Conclusion:
Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is
abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall
fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management system, demonstrating their
undisputed ability to responsibly and pre-emptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital
arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly adopted technologies aimed at effectively
navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavours undertaken in
this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent
practices.
Astonishingly, I am pondering how it is that, despite being shown that U. S. Banks business conduct was
insufficient insofar as background checks are concerned, they keep refuting their indisputable role and
responsibility in connection with the matter herein discussed. The points that I have hitherto made are too
crucial to be taken lightly. U. S. Banks non-observance of the fundamental principles of justice  that is,
to completely overlook and not even remotely try to mitigate the suffering of vulnerable consumers is
inexcusable given the size of the establishment and the vast resources at its disposal as the direct result of
the patronage of clients like myself.
If it was, indeed, solely my responsibility, we must then believe at least one of the following clauses: a)
financial institutions have absolutely no role whatsoever in preventing and detecting fraud, b) the fraud in
question was not reasonably foreseeable, or c) the transactions in question were not sufficiently alarming.
It is extremely unfortunate that U. S. Bank pushes quite hard for me to believe all three of these things
despite evidence to the contrary.
In summary, I respectively ask your organisation to consider my points, given your personal and
companywide obligation to provide a fair and reasonable investigation into the complaint.
I look forward to your input and would gladly cooperate to reach a fair and reasonable outcome.
Thank you.

Demand for Return of Funds
XX/XX/2024
U.S. Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MN XXXX Re: XXXX XXXX XXXX Account number: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Demand for Return of Funds Dear XXXX  or XXXX, I am writing to you concerning my account referenced above to notify you that the transactions described below were fraudulent, and to demand that funds in the amount of XXXX  be returned immediately.
The Transactions
I made the following transfers from the Account:
Date Amount Recipient InstitutionXX/XX/2024 XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/2024 XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
All of the foregoing transfers were the result of fraud. Specifically, I bonded with an individual online and
got introduced to investing in a seemingly innocent manner. She directed me to a carefully replicated
XXXX  Markets website, under the domain m.dml-markets.cc. Initially, I seemed to be profiting from my
investments, according to their platform. However, I was later notified that my account and funds had
been frozen due to suspicious activity and leveraged on my trust and fear of slipping into an unfortunate
financial situation, successfully tricking me into depositing additional funds in order to resolve the issue.
Ultimately, I was unable to complete further transfer requests they made. Despite the highly irregular
nature of these transactions compared to my usual patterns, I was never approached for clarification by
any institution involved.
Please note the following:
 I have never transacted with cryptocurrency in such a manner before.
 The pattern of the Transactions fits within well-known fraudulent schemes.
 I am an elderly individual.
 The bank failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect elderly customers from known fraud
schemes, potentially violating the ""reasonable security"" standard under various state laws.
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's guidelines on preventing elder financial abuse
suggest that banks should have systems in place to detect and prevent this type of fraud
 The bank did not attempt to contact me to verify this large, unusual transaction before processing
it, which may be considered a failure in their duty of care.
Demand for Return of Funds
Basis For Demand
The foregoing Transactions were fraudulent, and I am therefore entitled to have the amounts set forth
above returned to my account pursuant to the representations made by you. See XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Further, the Transactions had all the clear markings of well-known scams, about which you have been
repeatedly warned by law enforcement and other government agencies. Your facilitation of the
Transactions is another basis for the return of the Funds. See XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX (applying the should have known standard under statute); see alsoXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX).
Right to File Claim
Nothing in this letter should be construed as a waiver of my rights to damages not expressly set forth
herein. It is my hope that the Funds are returned quickly, and that no further action is necessary.
If we cannot reach a resolution, then I will have no choice but to file an arbitration claim pursuant to your
terms and conditions.

Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX:
The Office of the President received your request for assistance. We appreciate the opportunity to respond to your
c o n c e r n s .
We regret any frustration or inconvenience this matter may have caused you. We understand that being the victim of a
scam can be confusing, time consuming, and inconvenient.
Upon receiving your request for assistance, our records confirm two claims were opened with our Wire Department on
XXXX XXXX  which debited your account ending XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amounts of XXXX XXXX XXXX. A
request was sent to the beneficiary bank for recall of these funds.
Please know, the receiving institution is not obligated to return these funds or respond to our request. The elapsed time
from the time of the transfers to the time of the claim submission limits the chances of recalling the funds. We
recommend you also continue working directly with your local law enforcement officials to attempt to recover your
money from the beneficiary of this payment.
Please refer to the section of the Your Deposit Account Agreement (Agreement) titled Funds Transfers, which states, ""A
wire transfer is irrevocable once payment has been transmitted to the beneficiary's bank. At your request, we may
request that the beneficiary's bank return funds previously transferred. However, you acknowledge that the beneficiary's
bank is under no obligation to comply with this request."" The most current copy of the Agreement is available on
usbank.com or at your local U.S. Bank branch. The Agreement is also included with the documentation provided when a
new account is opened.
Our customers are generally protected from liability for unauthorized transactions or fraud. Any transactions you initiate
are considered authorized by you. Also, if you send funds to someone for products or services, and they fail to deliver the
desired service, it becomes a civil matter and unfortunately falls outside of our ability to recover those funds. We
recommend you continue to work with the recipient of the funds to request a refund. You may also consider working with
your local law enforcement officials to attempt to recover your money from the beneficiary of this payment.
In your correspondence you enclosed a statement and mention four additional fraudulent transfers on your account
ending XXXX  in the amounts oXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Please note, we were unable to locate any claims on
the transactions mentioned above. If there are transactions you believe should be disputed, please contact our Fraud
Dispute Intake team at XXXX to file a claim, where representatives are available to assist you XXXX  hours a day,
seven days a week (we accept relay calls).
Additionally, in your correspondence you also expressed concern regarding our alleged failure to prevent the above
transactions from occurring. A review of the wire interaction confirmed the branch representative asked appropriate
verification questions and determined you had previously sent similar wires.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,CA,92027,Older American,Consent provided,Web,11/14/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10794902
11/15/2024,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"I have a "" XXXX  '' savings account under my name at Wells Fargo for my child. My child was a victim of XXXX  wherein fraudsters contacted him and threatened him and demanded money. My child made several XXXX XXXX payments through the Wells Fargo banking application on his phone to the scammers, as follows : XXXX ) XX/XX/year> in the amount of {$550.00} via XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX ) XX/XX/year> in the amount of {$50.00} via XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX ) XX/XX/year> in the amount of {$250.00} via XXXX. 
XXXX ) XX/XX/year> in the amount of {$250.00} via XXXX. 
XXXX ) XX/XX/year> in the amount of {$500.00} via XXXX- which Wells Fargo declined and did not complete the transaction because there was suspicious activity/possible fraud. 

On XX/XX/year> my XXXX  alerted me to the situation and I visited my neighborhood branch on XX/XX/year>. I worked with the branch XXXX to submit disputes for the XXXX ( XXXX ) {$250.00} payments made via XXXX on XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, respectively. The branch XXXX also submitted a claim on the {$500.00} payment made via XXXX on XX/XX/year> because he said he wanted to do that just to be on the safe side. I was given a printed summary of my visit to the branch, with the following reference/case numbers : XXXX ) Ref # XXXX in regard to the {$500.00} payment on XX/XX/year> via XXXX. 
XXXX ) Ref # XXXX in regard to the {$250.00} payment on XX/XX/year> via XXXX. 
XXXX ) Ref # XXXX in regard to the {$250.00} payment on XX/XX/year> via XXXX. 

Wells Fargo responded to the XXXX claims approximately XXXX weeks later ( Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX me that they would respond within XXXX business days. There were never provisional credits made for the XXXX {$250.00} payments ). This is a violation of Regulation XXXX due to no provisional credit being issued by the bank and the time to resolve the claim was longer than 30 days ( even though the letters I eventually received were dated XX/XX/year> - the same day I visited the branch to make the dispute claims ). 

The results of the banks research as stated in those letters is outlined below : XXXX ) Ref # XXXX in regard to the {$500.00} stated that there was no error as Wells Fargo had not completed the transaction and money had never been debited from my account. I have no issue with that but will point out that this transaction was initiated on XX/XX/year> ( same day as a {$250.00} payment was sent, also via XXXX and XXXX days prior to the XXXX XXXX XXXX payments totaling {$600.00} were initiated ). Wells Fargo detected suspicious activity and shut down the transaction. 
XXXX ) Both claims on Ref # XXXX and Ref # XXXX regarding the XXXX {$250.00} XXXX payments on XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, respectively, were denied. Wells Fargo stated that no error had occurred. 

The reason that there were no claims submitted by myself and the branch XXXX regarding the XXXX XXXX payments totaling {$600.00} is because my XXXX  had called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/year> and requested to cancel those payments and was informed that the cancellations were successful. Additionally, the bank account showed that the payments were pended and did not go through ; therefore, the branch XXXX advised that it was not necessary to submit claims for those XXXX cancelled payments. What I believe actually happened is that the representative that my child spoke with at Wells Fargo on the night of XX/XX/year> advised that the bank would provide provisional credits for the {$50.00} and {$550.00} XXXX XXXX payments while the bank researched the inquiry. I believed that the payments were voided based on my childs conversation with the bank and a letter I received weeks later stating that the account had been provisionally credited in the amount of {$600.00}. There was a reference number on that letter : XXXX. 

After receiving the XXXX denial letters, I visited the same branch on XX/XX/year> to appeal the decisions and have the cases for the XXXX {$250.00} payments via XXXX escalated to the banks XXXX office as no one had ever contacted me to obtain the police report number and FBI report I filed with their XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX division. I was given a new reference number for the escalated case : XXXX and the branch XXXX scanned all of the additional documentation with the full FBI report into the Wells Fargo system. 

I received several emails from Wells Fargo after XX/XX/year>, and each time it stated that more time was needed to research my case. These emails originated from Wells Fargos executive office, therefore I believed that these emails were in regard to the XXXX office escalated case number XXXX for the XXXX {$250.00} XXXX payments. 

Finally, on XX/XX/year>, I received another email from Wells Fargos executive office stating that the claim for the XXXX Apple Cash payments ( {$600.00} together ) was finally resolved and that Wells Fargo concluded through its research that no processing error occurred and that the bank would deduct the provisional credit in the amount of {$600.00} from my account on XX/XX/year>. This email that I received on XX/XX/year> was received 92 days after the call my child placed regarding these transactions on XX/XX/year>. That is a violation of Regulation XXXX due to the time it took to research the case. 

I have not yet heard back from Wells Fargo about the appeal on the XXXX {$250.00} XXXX payments. I am placing this complaint in part to explain that Wells Fargo is not putting appropriate protections on its minor accounts. The bank grants access to minors to its online app and offers XXXX  the ability to make payments from that app. The bank is an owner of XXXX and there are well-documented cases and investigations by the CFPB into XXXX high number of claims that consumers make regarding XXXX, which the banks ( not just Wells Fargo XXXX but XXXX, XXXX well ) summarily denyXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXs a major problem in this country. There are no protections in place at Wells Fargo and other banks to prevent the exact situation that I went through from happening to more and more children each and every day. 

Wells Fargo knew very well that the transactions on my childs minor account were suspicious and yet the payments were allowed to go through. In fact, the bank stopped a XXXX payment that my child initiated on XX/XX/year> because it detected the fraudulent and/or suspicious activity. Then, XXXX full days later, it allowed XXXX XXXX XXXX payments to go through, even though there were the same clear signs of suspicious activity. I was notified of nothing. Obviously when the FBI opens a case in the XXXX and XXXX XXXX unit, and there is ample information with names, email addresses, phone numbers, and screenshots from the scammers all also provided to Wells Fargo there is merit to the argument that these are cases of fraud and scams.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,AZ,85044,None,Consent provided,Web,11/15/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10816089
11/6/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),"I am experiencing issues with my mortgage servicer, RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC, regarding the removal of escrow and Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) from my mortgage account. Despite fulfilling all specified requirements, including maintaining a Loan-to-Value ( LTV ) ratio well below the required 80 %, RoundPoint Mortgage has repeatedly added new conditions, delayed the process, and provided conflicting information, preventing the removal of both PMI and escrow. 

Complaint Details : Initial Request and Requirements Fulfilled : On XX/XX/year>, I requested to have the escrow removed from my mortgage. RoundPoint acknowledged receipt of my request on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX. and informed me that PMI would need to be removed first to proceed. 
I submitted a request to remove PMI and provided all necessary documentation, including a Broker Price Opinion ( BPO ) that confirmed my LTV is well below the 80 % threshold required for PMI removal. The BPO was completed and returned to RoundPoint on XX/XX/year>, as confirmed by the broker who submitted it. 
Repeated Delays and Added Stipulations : Despite meeting the required conditions, RoundPoint has repeatedly delayed the process by introducing new, uncommunicated stipulations. Most recently, on XX/XX/year>, RoundPoint added a requirement that PMI and escrow can not be removed because the property is located in a FEMA-designated disaster area. 
This FEMA-related stipulation was never disclosed in prior communications or outlined in my mortgage documents. Each time I fulfill a requirement, RoundPoint imposes additional stipulations, effectively preventing the timely removal of PMI and escrow. This pattern of continually moving the goalposts appears to be a tactic to maintain escrow and PMI, creating undue frustration and financial burden. 
Escrow Payment Increase Without Adjustment : My monthly mortgage payment increased from {$3600.00} to {$4300.00} due to a significant rise in my propertys assessed value. If the property value had not increased, this payment adjustment would not have occurred. Despite this, my Homestead Credit has not been applied, and my escrow payments have only increased with no reduction or adjustment, contrary to CFPB Regulation 1024.17, which governs escrow maintenance and adjustments. 
Similar Complaints from Other Customers : Through research, I found multiple similar complaints from other RoundPoint Mortgage customers, who have faced similar delays and additional requirements when attempting to remove PMI and escrow. These practices appear to be systemic and designed to prevent timely removal of these obligations. 
Request for Resolution : I am seeking the CFPBs assistance to : Ensure RoundPoint Mortgage complies with federal regulations and my mortgage agreement, particularly regarding escrow adjustments and the removal of PMI. 
Obtain immediate removal of PMI and escrow based on my LTV compliance and the fulfillment of all disclosed requirements. 
Investigate RoundPoint Mortgages practices concerning delays, additional stipulations, and FEMA-related restrictions that were not previously disclosed, to ensure fair treatment of all customers. 
Supporting Documentation : Copies of all communication with RoundPoint Mortgage regarding PMI and escrow removal. 
BPO verifying my LTV is below 80 %.

I received a message for a security code to be entered with code from my mobile device. I entered the code and was still unable to get access to my online banking. I then attempted to login on my phone and was able to access my accounts and noticed a large amount of money was missing from my business account. I then called the fraud department for Wells Fargo to report that I did not authorize the "" pending '' wire transfer of {$18000.00} from my account ( call occurred 5 minutes after the incident ). The representative proceeded to work on my claim request and start a recall. I told him I did not know the intended receiver of the wire transfer and was unaware that the wire was being sent to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I received a call on Tuesday, XX/XX/year>, at XXXX PM, stating that my claim was being processed and if I had any questions or concerns or would like to add any additional information to the claim, to call. I returned this call Tuesday, XX/XX/year>, at XXXX PM, and was told my claim had been denied without opportunity to provide any additional documentation. During the follow up call at XXXX PM, the Wells Fargo representative did say the claim was denied due to the wire transfer being initiated from a known mobile device, but none of that information is mentioned in the denial letter that I received or documentation to show how this determination was made. I have not been able to speak with or have received a return call from anyone that was involved with the investigation of my fraud claim. There is only the one missed follow up call from Wells Fargo on Tuesday, XX/XX/year>, at XXXX PM. I have only spoken with representatives that have answered my calls and made notes to send over for review. There also has been on documentation or information provided to show investigation of the inconsistency in the transaction based on the other activities of my account. This fraudulent wire transfer has been reported to the police for further investigation. On Tuesday, XX/XX/year>, I visited my neighborhood Wells Fargo branch with supporting documentation including the case number for my police report and submitted a appeal to my initial claim. On XX/XX/year>, I received an email that my appeal was also denied with no further information to support this decision.

11/8/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am petitioning once again for the crediting of {$2600.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX and Barclaycard US to XXXX XXXX XXXX, since there is new information included. Barclaycard US is very deficient in resolving issues for their clients. They allowed XXXX XXXX XXXX to rebill an outstanding disputed charge on my card without my knowledge. 
I proved where the company had inappropriately billed me twice for {$2600.00}. The person at XXXX XXXX XXXX was supposed to get this credited, but left the company before this was completed. His name is XXXX XXXX. 
I had worked with XXXX XXXX to get my site up after the second time it was taken down. We agreed to {$2600.00} for "" bandwidth '' issues ( I have proof of this ). 
The company double-billed me. XXXX was going to resolve but ended up leaving the company. I called one day to try again to resolve the situation, and someone answered as XXXX. I knew it wasn't him - mannerisms and voice tone were different. I asked to be transferred to Accounts Pay to retrieve my money that was double-billed. XXXX ( whom i find later is the XXXX ) answered and said, "" Thank you XXXX ''. I told her that XXXX impersonated and said he was XXXX. She acted surprised but now I know they all just play games. I filed reports with the Federal Trade Commission - FTC # XXXX and FTC # XXXX and there are many other documents that back up my story. 
This was the second company with whom I had to dispute charges because XXXX XXXX XXXX are underhanded thieves posing as a website design company. THere were multiple disputes with XXXX XXXX. The only reason these were resolved is because XXXX XXXX - also no longer with the company stepped out of the storm to resolved the problems I had disputed. He also sent me info that XXXX was impersonating ex-employees. You will see this attached.

ANY company who does not see the unlawful, immoral, criminal activity in all this should NOT EVEN BE IN BUSINESS. Many laws are broken here - and yet I the consumer am still being help accountable for this money I DO NOT OWE. I have proven that we agreed upon {$2600.00} - and that this rebill was never authorized BarclaycardUS is a disgrace parading as a business and they are simply thieves trying to make the scapegoat for their ineptitude. They are criminally negligent in their dealings with consumers. They won't even own up to their mistakes- which are too many to recall here.

Instead, they sent my disputes to be resolved with the 4 credit bureaus. I locked my card before I realized what had happened and tore up the card - and still because XXXX XXXX XXXX had sold my information on the dark web - the card number was used to purchase some video thing - which I have no clue about. I disputed this charge but Barclaycard is holding me responsible for this charge also. They would not close the card for me when I asked after I realized I had been double or rebilled. 
Finally one of the reps- whom are all VERY BACKWARD because the company is also BACKWARD = finally closed the card and did a reissue. I have never activated this card and will NEVER USE IT. I see on reviews that Barclaycard treats their customers very poorly and is very inept. They are up to their eyebrows in inappropriate billings to customers who are supposed to pay for monies for which they are not responsible. 
Barclaycard has no record of when I locked the original card since was destroyed. Further on XX/XX/year>. I called and spoke with XXXX at Barclaycard customer service. I asked her about the dispute, and she said XXXX was unable to close it. I said that This is a blessing from XXXX, and told her to never close the dispute because I felt something shifty going on. ( But with Barclaycard you never receive a straight answer or the same answer twice in row. Barclaycard in their own way is as bad as XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is a no-win situation with both companies for consumers. Well, sure enough the XXXX crooked companies rebilled this without my consent and without talking to me. What kind of business does this kind of stuff? There is NO CONFUSION. I knew exactly what they were doing and I did NOT agree to pay {$5200.00}. I have proven this with the information that I have provided After I had petitioned previously for my money to be refunded, XXXX XXXX XXXX called me on XX/XX/year> at XXXXXXXX XXXX. My husband XXXX XXXX XXXX and myself were on the call with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX said he knows that he double-billed me the {$2600.00} plus the accruing interest but he said he would NOT refund my money. How crazy and brazen is this? I would never want to do business with this very crooked company again. I believe that this company is not even located in the United States. The XXXX XXXX XXXX showing XXXX XXXX, CA, I believe to be a front company. They want to fleece the American public. The feeling I received from XXXX XXXX is that it is his RIGHT to do business in this fraudulent way and not correct the wrong. 
I reminded XXXX XXXX that XXXX XXXX impersonated the ex-employee XXXX XXXX to connive and defraud me of this money and that there are FTC reports noted above in this petition and this is a federal offense. XXXX XXXX said he knew that XXXX had done this and that XXXX XXXX was fired because of such = and that was supposed to satisfy me. Wrong! XXXX XXXX maintained that he will NOT refund this ill-begotten, fraudulently-obtained money, that Barclay assisted XXXX to steal from me.

I think this is OUTRAGEOUS, and only a corrupt company and people would allow this to go on. XXXX XXXX KNOWS THIS IS WRONG AND WILL NOT CORRECT IT or REFUND MY MONEY. We argued with XXXX XXXX, but he is intent is clear that he intended to defraud me of this money with the help of Barclaycard US.

- Date of applying for the first Skypass Visa Signature Card : XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX  ( no regulation change, meeting spending requirement in XXXX months ) -> I got XXXX welcome reward. 
- Date of applying for the second Skypass Visa Signature Card : XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX ( not sure about regulation change, meeting spending requirement in XXXX  months ) -> I did not get XXXX welcome reward so far. 

- Regulation for first Skypass Visa Signature Card "" SKYPASS Visa Signature Card : Spend {$4000.00} in Net Purchases with your SKYPASS Visa Signature Card within the first XXXX days of account opening and earn a one-time bonus of XXXX Bonus Miles.

XXXX I am not sure whether they include the sentence in the regulation below when I made my second card. 
[ Existing or previous SKYPASS Visa Signature card members are not eligible if you have received a new account bonus for this product in the last XXXX years. '' ] - My opinion XXXX : When I made the XXXX XXXX, I also did not see this inclusion. Thus, they should provide me with XXXX welcome rewards. 

- My opinion XXXX : If there was an inclusion, there was no notice about it. It should be considered that it was a hidden change which US bank deliberately concealed with intention of refraining from giving a welcome bonus. In the case of XXXX, if I am not eligible for welcome reward while applying for a credit card, there is pop-up letting me know. Because of their intentional conceal, they should provide me with XXXX welcome rewards. 

- My opinion XXXX : If there was an inclusion at the moment when I applied for the second card, the new inclusion should not be applied retroactively. The added rule ( existing or previous SKYPASS Visa Signature card members are not eligible if you have received a new account bonus for this product in the last XXXX years ) should not be applied to the first card since each card is a different product with a different rule.

Subject : Response to XXXXnadequate Validation and Notice of Intent to Proceed with Arbitration Account Number : XXXX Dear Kikoff Customer Support, I am writing in response to your email regarding my dispute of inaccurate information reported to credit bureaus and the accompanying documents you provided. After reviewing your response, I have determined that your investigation and validation are insufficient to meet the requirements under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and other applicable consumer protection laws. 
Issues with Kikoffs Response and Documentation Failure to Provide Proper Validation : The payment history document provided does not substantiate the accuracy of the information you reported. A proper validation must include : Specific dates payments were due and made. 
Evidence that the information reported was accurate and not misleading. 
The document fails to meet this standard, making the reported information unverifiable and inaccurate. 
Lack of Adequate Notification : Your email references email reminders, but there is no evidence provided to confirm that these were received or acknowledged. Sole reliance on email, which could be filtered or overlooked, does not meet the standard for proper notification under the FCRA. 
Misrepresentation of Consumer Rights : Your statement that historical activity remains with the bureaus and can not be removed misrepresents my rights under the FCRA. Any inaccurate or unverifiable information must be corrected or removed, regardless of its status as historical. 
Inadequate Investigation : Your investigation appears to rely solely on internal records without conducting a reasonable and thorough review, as required under the FCRA. This does not address the specifics of my dispute or provide evidence of a proper validation process. 
Failure to Apply Grace Periods : Your response mentions a 30-day grace period, but there is no evidence showing this was consistently applied before reporting any alleged delinquencies.

Notice of Intent to Proceed with Arbitration Given Kikoff , Inc.s failure to resolve this matter and its continued violations of my consumer rights, I have no choice but to pursue arbitration as outlined in the Kikoff Credit Account Agreement. A Notice of Dispute will be sent to your legal address : HERE IS THE TRACKING NUMBER FOR CERTIFIED MAIL ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Kikoff Lending , LLC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX This notice will detail the violations and the relief I am seeking.

Thank you for your time. I will also be filing formal complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and any applicable regulatory bodies overseeing Kikoff Lending , Inc., to address your continued violations of consumer protection laws.

11/16/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Credit inquiries on your report that you don't recognize,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a dispute and request to XXXX requesting certification under FCRA section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) as instructed by me that I gave permission to disseminate my credit report. I am writing to formally file a complaint against XXXX regarding multiple unauthorized disclosures of my credit report to creditors included in my XXXX  XXXX Bankruptcy proceedings, as well as other violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). These unauthorized actions have caused significant harm to my credit and have been done without my consent or any permissible purpose. 

Background and Unauthorized Credit Report Disclosures : In XXXX, I filed for XXXX  XXXX Bankruptcy, and as part of that process, certain accounts were discharged, including those with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending # XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Ending # XXXX ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX However, XXXX continued to disseminate my credit report to these and other creditors despite the discharge of these debts. 

Select Portfolio Servicing ( Account Ending # XXXX ) : This account was included in my XXXX  XXXX Bankruptcy and discharged in XXXX. Despite this, XXXX continued to report a balance on this account for XXXX months, from XXXX through XXXX, and shared my credit report with XXXX XXXX XXXX without any permissible purpose. 

XXXX XXXX ( Account Ending # XXXX ) : Similarly, this account was included in the bankruptcy, but XXXX continued to report it as a charge-off, which is inaccurate and misleading. This reporting is contrary to the discharge of the debt, and XXXX had no legal basis for continuing to share this information with creditors. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX provided my credit report to XXXX XXXX XXXX on several occasions, including : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX However, XXXX XXXX XXXX has sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, confirming that they have not placed any credit inquiries on my report. I am submitting this correspondence as evidence that these credit inquiries were unauthorized. 

Fifth Third Bank : This account was also included in my XXXX XXXX Bankruptcy, and XXXX provided my credit report to XXXX XXXX XXXX on multiple occasions : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Since this debt was discharged, these actions constitute unauthorized access to my credit report and violations of the FCRA. 

Request for Compensation and Remediation : These unauthorized disclosures have caused significant damage to my credit, and I am requesting the following remedies : Statutory Damages : I am requesting {$38000.00} in statutory damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) for these violations, which I understand are actionable under Section 1681n of the FCRA, which allows for recovery of actual or statutory damages up to {$1000.00} per violation. 

In addition to the damages for unauthorized access to my credit report, I am also entitled to statutory damages for willful noncompliance by XXXX under Section 1681n of the FCRA. 

Inquiries Removal : I am requesting that all unauthorized credit inquiries be deleted from my credit report, including those made by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX  , as they were not made with a permissible purpose under Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA. 

Cease Unauthorized Access : I request that XXXX cease disclosing my credit report to these creditors and any other unauthorized parties. Any future disclosures should only occur with written consent from me, in accordance with the requirements of the FCRA. 

Legal Support and Case Law : The actions of XXXX in disseminating my credit report without a permissible purpose and continuing to report inaccurate information violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), specifically Sections 604 and 1681n. These statutory violations have been addressed in case law within the XXXX XXXX and across XXXX XXXX, which have consistently held that consumers are entitled to damages for improper reporting and disclosure. 

FCRA Section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ) limits who can access a consumers credit report to those with a permissible purpose. 
FCRA Section 1681n provides for statutory damages of up to {$1000.00} per violation for willful noncompliance.

Case law supports that reporting of discharged debts post-bankruptcy or the unauthorized access to consumer credit reports is an actionable violation under the FCRA. 
I am attaching all relevant documentation, including my XXXX XXXX Discharge Order, correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and any other evidence supporting my claim. 

Conclusion : I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate these actions and assist in securing the requested {$38000.00} in statutory damages for these violations, as well as require XXXX to remove the unauthorized inquiries from my credit report and cease further unauthorized disclosures. My consumer report has had a freeze for well over XXXX  months, and these unauthorized inquiries are unlawful and in violation of my rights. XXXX has a history of requesting copies of an individual 's id and social security when it was included in the original dispute as a stalling tactic. Exhibits of correspondence attached, dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and keep me informed of any developments. Should you need any further information contact me.

Despite these actions, Eastern has reported this account to my consumer credit report. 

these actions are in direct violation of the FDCPA, which prohibits debt collectors from continuing to collect on disputed debt without proper validation. Reporting the account to credit bureaus while its under dispute also violates my rights under the FCRA. 

I have attempted to resolve this matter, I requested Eastern to send me specific information to validate the alleged debt. instead they only sent me a bill of the debt ; Eastern needs to send me the original contract or agreement that outlines the terms of the debt, including the amount owed and the date it originated. I need a complete history of payments made toward the debt, including dates, amounts, and how those payments were applied. also the name of any other entities that may have owned or serviced the debt prior to collection.

I need documentation that proves the collection agency has the legal right to collect on the debt, including any assignment or transfer of the debt.

I need details on when the debt was reported to credit bureaus, including information on how it is impacting my credit report. 

I have attempted to resolve this matter directly with the collection agency, but they have ignored my requests and continued their collection efforts.

They said they had checked my credit score via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and it was XXXX. The explanation they gave for changing the rate was as follows : 1 ) My current APR was lower that what they currently offer consumers with the same score who apply today ( I've had this card for over 3 years ) 2 ) My current credit profile shows the following problems a ) Balances vs limits is too high b ) Most recent account opening is too short c ) Too many accounts with balances d ) Too few accounts currently paid as agreed. Reasons a, b, c & d are all false and untrue. I only have 3 open credit accounts to my name and none have high credit limits -- Costco Citi card is the highest, actually. 

I'm not sure whose credit score or history they are looking at but it's not mine because non of those reasons applies to my credit or history. I went to my XXXX online account to check my credit score and it is currently XXXX. XXXX also shows the same credit score. It had been at a low of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  but it hasn't been below XXXX at any point this year. I can also see that Citibank never pulled a soft or hard credit check through XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. My account history shows they ( CitiBank ) pulled soft credit checks on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of this year. There was nothing pulled from XXXX ( as they reference in their letter ) on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called the Costco Citibank customer service to ask who I could speak to about the errors they are basing this large increase on and getting it reversed as my payment history with them is stellar. I was told, on two separate phone calls to them, there was ABSOLUTELY NO ONE I can speak to in their organization about changing this rate or reporting the errors they've based these changes on. SERIOUSLY???? I also went to my local Costco location to report this. They can't do a thing but I want them to know that there is potential consumer fraud being committed by CitiBank. I only throw up this red flag because they were adamant ( and I spoke to XXXX different CSRs ) that nothing can be done. I asked for a referral to a "" higher up '' or the credit division and they said there wasn't any recourse. Do you understand why I'm not only frustrated but concerned and angry? If they made wholesale changes to the base rates, they should simply say so. I asked that question but was told they can't speak to me about my credit report so it must not be a company wide increase.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MT,59801,None,Consent provided,Web,11/23/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10912739

11/15/2024,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Loan sold or transferred to another company,"This complaint is in reference to the property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, VA XXXX. XXXX XXXX owned this property for decades. The home was given to her. She grew up in the house. Many members of my family grew up in this house. It is our family home for over 4 generations. After XXXX XXXXs husband passed ( XXXX XXXX XXXX deceased for nearly 10 years ), she was the only owner on title until her passing in XXXX. Following her death, the property was put into a trust. That particular trust had XXXX XXXX, a minor child, listed as the primary beneficiary of the property mentioned above ( I, XXXX XXXX, am the trustee of XXXX XXXX 's property ). Since XXXX, the company M & T Bank confirmed with us that they were sending mortgage statements in the name of the deceased, XXXX XXXX XXXX. After years of negligence, addressing the mortgage to the incorrect party ( not even the current owner, XXXX XXXX, M & T bank decided to place this mortgage account with the company XXXX XXXX to commence with collections efforts and foreclosure proceedings. The foreclosure, also confirmed by XXXX from M & T bank ( on a recorded call from Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX around the time XXXX EST ), commenced in XX/XX/XXXX. We were made aware of this a few weeks ago, when I received a letter in the mail from XXXX XXXX saying the property would be auctioned on XX/XX/XXXX. It was also stated and confirmed by the representative from M & T mentioned above, that mail was going to the address in the name of the incorrect party for years. The mail was being sent to the property in the name of the deceased, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was not an owner of the property after his passing. The title was passed to XXXX solely via right of survivorship. The current residents had no reason to open any mail addressed to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX who did live at the property until attending college this fall ( turning XXXX in XXXX ), had no knowledge of any financial responsibility to M & T Bank. Again, he was a minor until XXXX of this year. I received no notification of any late payments via mortgage statements or otherwise as the trustee of this property belonging to XXXX. 

Long story short, M & T Bank never properly advised or disclosed to the correct/responsible parties that the home was behind on payments. They began foreclosure proceedings before the beneficiary of the trust was legally of age to receive such documentation, and myself as the trustee was never notified until I received a letter in the mail referencing an auction next month for the property. I believe this is a violation of our rights. It feels unfair to sell our family home from under us after years of negligence while addressing incorrect parties via mail only about any past due balances. They couldn't address the right parties then, but when it came time to auction the house, they got in contact with us just fine. It feels like M & T Bank is stealing from us and forcing us to incur fees for their inner-workings in their foreclosure process. I believe this also to be a UDAAP violation ( if it applies to mortgages ), and it is certainly a Reg Z/TILA violation as well. I believe this could also be a deeper issue relating to HMDA.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,M&T BANK CORPORATION,VA,23227,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/15/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10811428

11/5/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I did a routine check of my credit card balances through Bank of America ( BoA ). During this check, I had noticed a suspicious pending charge from XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$590.00} on my Bank of America card ending in XXXX. After locking the card using the mobile app, I immediately reached out to the customer service fraud center at BoA to report this activity. The representative asked me several questions regarding this charge and I answered truthfully that I did not authorize and had no knowledge of this pending charge. The charge description showed that the event was called XXXX XXXX XXXX which appears to be an event that took place in XXXX in California based on a XXXX search. I had indicated to the representative, that I did not purchase any tickets for this event and did not give my card to anyone to do so. I never received any tickets or correspondence from this merchant. The representative assured me that this would be investigated and that the charge would be removed in the meantime. The representative said that they did not need any additional information from me at that time. The representative issued a new card ending in XXXX as expected in a case of possible fraud. I destroyed the old card in the meantime while waiting for a new card. The BoA claim ID is XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was sent a Bank of America email stating that the claim was complete, but Bank of America reversed their decision and re-applied the charge of {$590.00}. Bank of America indicated through the emailed letter that the charge was made on an approved device such as a cell phone or tablet. I immediately reached out to the Bank of America Fraud Center on XX/XX/XXXX for further explanation, but I was not provided any additional information outside of what was indicated on the letter. I went over the same details from the original call and was reassured that the claim would be reopened and more details will be provided under the original claim ID. I believe the representative also said that the charge would be removed again. As of this complaint that charge remains in place and I have received no new information from any Bank of America representative. 
While waiting for further feedback from Bank of America, I became more proactive and gathered more information on my end. The fraudulent transaction provided a contact website and phone number for a ticketing company called XXXX XXXX XXXX  I decided to reach out to their customer service on the evening of XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a representative named XXXX. The representative was helpful and attempted to try and find more information about this charge. I provided my name, phone number, email, and the last 4 digits of the card that was charged. She was unable to find any transaction on their end matching any of my details. She agreed to send me an email confirming the phone call and also suspecting a fraudulent charge. 
The Bank of America credit card transaction details also state that the charge was made through the web ( credit card not present ). I only own two devices ( 1 cell phone and 1 laptop ). I only use the XXXX XXXX XXXX so I was able to retrieve my entire browsing history for all devices from the date of the charge. There are no web site visits to the ticketing company XXXX XXXX XXXX or any other ticketing agency. I also pulled up my XXXX location history that shows I did not travel on the date of the charge to California assuming the purchase was made for the music event in California. It should be noted that I have not traveled to California in at least 15 years. Bank of America will find no local California charges made in California during that time frame. 

I am concerned that Bank of America is accusing me of making a false claim of fraud, so I have reached out to my local police department in XXXX, CT and filed a report. I reiterated all the details to the officer assigned to make the report. The case # from the XXXX, CT Police is XXXX. 

I called Bank of America again on XX/XX/XXXX to see if there are any new updates, but still haven't received anything regarding this re-opened claim ID. The charge remains and the mobile app and website indicate the claim is still "" complete ''. I did provide the police case number to the representative as new information. The representative says it is still pending but again reassured me that it will be resolved. I have greatly increased my BOA account settings and according to their website metrics, I am almost at the highest level of security to prevent unauthorized access. Bank of America had indicated in their claim denial that they considered my account history. It should note that I have been a Bank of America customer for roughly 20 years with 2 credit cards in active use. This was the first time that I have seen a fraudulent charge on either account and would hope that Bank of America would take this into account and remove this fraudulent charge as assured by several fraud center representatives.

The problem started on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  when Citi declined a payment for an online train ticket purchase from XXXX XXXX because of suspected fraud. I called from my phone with my XXXX XXXX number, and was not able to verify my identity because I didnt have my bank account number or the number of another Citi card with me. Fair enough. So I went to the train station and paid for the tickets with my XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
It then occurred to me that I could maybe still use that card though XXXX XXXX, so I used XXXX XXXX to pay for a small drugstore purchase on XX/XX/XXXX, and that went through. So I used XXXX XXXX for the round trip ticket XXXX XXXX which I purchased from the bus conductor as we entered the bus. When I saw that this charge was declined after we arrived in XXXX, I called Citi again, and this time identity verification worked as they texted a code to my US phone number. I was told that block on my card was lifted and that I could use my card again. So I made used it at a coffee shop on XX/XX/XXXX with no problem. But then the charge to the XXXXXXXX XXXX company which they resubmitted on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX was again declined. Exasperated, I decided to wait until I got home to sort this out. 
I called Citi from my US phone number when I got home, explained the situation about the XXXX Bus charge, but verification entailed remembering a special word that I had forgotten. My card was again blocked and was told a code would be sent to me by mail. I asked if this could be reversed by a supervisor. It seems that no human can override what was clearly a computer generated nonsensical decision. How many people are honest enough to call to make sure a payment goes through in a foreign country after they have used a service, when the ticket was just a slip of paper with no identifying information on it? 
I called Citi again today with the code, my card was reactivated, but I was told that the charge to the XXXX XXXX XXXX would be paid when they resubmit that charge. They have already resubmitted that charge 5 times and I dont know if they will resubmit it again.

This complaint is against Citibank, the issuers of the LL Bean Master Card. I got the LL Bean master card application/filled out, at the checkout counter, at LL Bean where I have been shopping for over XXXX  years.

I tried it XXXX  times, and it was still denied. I have been going to XXXX, in XXXX, since XXXX, to have my dog groomed. Talk about a red face?? 

I used a different card, to pay for the dogs grooming, XXXX more reliable than Citibank LL Bean Master Card. 

When I got home, yesterday ( Sunday ), I called the XXXX customer service line, XXXX and I asked the agent why my new card had been denied at the register? 

I was told by the agent, I hadnt been verified yet. Hellooooo, earth calling Citibank would the intelligent among us, have verified me, before they even sent me the card???? 

I told the agent, I wanted them to send me a bill for what I owe, and I wanted the credit card cancelled. She responded that I can not CANCEL the card, even if I pay it off ( +- {$1000.00} due at this point, ), until they verify me. 

I called again, this morning ( Monday ), and was told the same thing. 

What I am asking the consumer financial protection bureaus help with. 

XXXX The bank behind this credit card, has the horse in front of the cart you verify a person, before you send a card out! Sending out a card, before verifying a person, is putting the person who owns that name, at financial risk, when Citi doesnt do a thorough job, before sending out credit cards. This sending of cards, to unverified people XXXX, should be a fineable offense. Its flat out, a dangerous policy. 

XXXX told the agent I wanted a final statement sent to me, immediately, which I would pay then I wanted the card cancelled, as its unreliable. The agent said I could not cancel/close the account, until I verified myself, WHAT???? I want the CFPB, to require that Citibank, send me a final statement, asap. I will pay that off.

It is frustrating to me that financial institutions continue to allow people to open financial accounts fraudulently in my name, using my information, despite there being both a fraud alert and my credit being frozen.

11/6/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"I am writing to express my deep frustration with the handling of a clear account takeover incident on my Wells Fargo account and the repeated denial of my claim. The events that have transpired since XX/XX/XXXX, alongside the numerous missed opportunities for intervention, have not only left me with a significant financial loss but also highlight systemic failures in fraud prevention and customer support. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I received a call appearing to be from Wells Fargo ( per CallerID ). The caller, who I now know was a scammer, verified my account through an authentication code sent to my phone ( by Wells Fargo system ) and alerted me to suspicious activity. While on the call, I pulled up my account and noted four declined charges, which he assured me were part of the fraudulent activity he would secure by issuing a new card. At that time, I hadnt realized my debit card was missing, thinking Id misplaced it at home. The scammer, who used highly detailed Wells Fargo contact center scripting, collected my cards PIN, the last four of my Social Security number, and the last four of my account number under the guise of account security. He even initiated a relay to send additional codes to my phone, which I unknowingly provided, giving him full access to make unauthorized transactions. While I believed my account was secure, an associate of his proceeded to make charges totaling {$10000.00} using my card. Later that evening, suspecting something was amiss, I contacted Wells Fargo only to discover that the call had not come from the bank. That there were additional charges on my account not currently in despite, and I was distraught. Despite the Caller ID showing Wells Fargo, they had no record of this call. I immediately reported the fraud, expecting prompt action. However, the response was underwhelming. My card was only reported stolen, and no further action was taken to suspend the account or escalate the case despite assurances to the contrary. Following are key interactions that illustrate my experience and further demonstrate the gaps in your
response : XX/XX/XXXX : I called again at XXXX XXXX, only to find no complaint or case notes lodged from the previous night. I had to escalate my complaint again, insisting on a formal investigation and restitution. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called to check on the status of my complaint, only to find no documentation on my case. Once more, I escalated the issue, expecting a response from the account takeover team. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received a letter denying my claim, stating no suspicious activity was found. This decision was in direct contradiction to the evidence I provided. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called to understand the denial rationale, speaking to a representative named XXXX, who gave no satisfactory explanation, so I escalated to XXXX. She mentioned the claim was denied because I had legitimate transactions between the fraudulent ones. These were unrelated, as they were online bill payments and not connected to the disputed debit card transactions. This lead to my case being reopened by a supervisor ( XXXX ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I learned that despite multiple escalations, the account takeover investigation had only been officially initiated on XX/XX/XXXX. By this time, nearly a month had passed since the initial fraud incident. 

XX/XX/XXXX : My claim was denied again with a dismissive explanation that the charges had been verified by Fraud Detection, stating calls originated from my phone. This blanket response disregards the facts of the account takeover and the manipulation involved.

Throughout this process, I raised valid concerns : 1. Why did four charges get approved after four were declined on my account without any intervention or account suspension? Most financial institutions require you to call when declined charges occur.

2. Why wasnt I alerted immediately after the multiple declined transactions, as other banks typically require verification before further transactions?

3. How can you ensure this wasnt an internal breach given the level of detail in the scammers approach, which closely mirrored Wells Fargos scripting and procedures? 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a secure email stating the denial of my claim for the same reason. This response is dismissive and fails to address the core issues : a breach of security protocols, failure to protect the account despite multiple warning signs, and neglect in promptly suspending my account after declined charges. I have asked Wells Fargo to : 1. Conduct a comprehensive investigation into the internal processes and to provide evidence that my account was not accessed improperly. 2. Provide a full refund of the {$10000.00} given the banks failure to prevent this fraudulent activity despite clear red flags. 3. Reinforce account security protocols to ensure that such breaches do not happen in the future.

As I am now on my fourth denial, two original letters without a phone call explanation, and two secured emails, I have not yet received my request nor have I been protected as a consumer nor have I been assured that all preventative actions are in place for future consumers. I've not been taken seriously and need the CFPB to reconsider your stance on this matter.

11/9/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","My mortgage was transferred/sold from Specailized Loan Servicing to Shellpoint Mortgage in XXXX of 2024. I continued to pay my payments of {$520.00} as usual. I started receiving letters stating that I didn't have insurance coverage from XXXX XXXX-XX/XX/2024. 
I called Shellpoint and spoke with a customer service representative that told me I would have to contact my insurance company and have them send proof for the month in question. I called my insurance company and requested they send something to Shellpoint verifying I had coverage during the month of XX/XX/year>. I thought everything was taken care of until I received another letter stating they would charge me {$85.00} for coverage in XXXX. I called and spoke Shellpoint again and was told I needed to have my insurance company send something to them to verify coverage. I again called my insurance company and asked them to send something to Shellpoint, They stated they had sent something to Shellpoint verifying coverage but would send it again. On XX/XX/XXXX I received my escrow analysis for the year. It stated that I had a shortage of {$2000.00}. This shortage would increase my payments from the {$520.00} I have been paying to {$590.00} a month. I called Shellpoint again and asked why my shortage was so significant. The customer service representative made me aware that Shellpoint Mortgage paid my insurance twice in the last year. Once it was paid in XX/XX/year> {$1400.00} and then again in XX/XX/year> {$1400.00}. I was told to resolve the issue I would need to contact my insurance company and have a refund issued, While on the phone I asked why I was still receiving letters about coverage in XX/XX/year> because the insurance company has sent the verification. They again told me they haven't received anything from my insurance company : I called my insurance company and spoke with them about refunding the overpayment. They had already issued a check and sent it to Shellpoint. I again asked if they could send something to Shellpoint proving I had coverage for XXXX. They stated they have sent documents to them several times but would again. The insurance refund finally was applied to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I called Shellpoint Mortgage again to request another escrow analysis since the refund was now in my escrow account. That analysis was done on XX/XX/XXXX. When I reviewed the analysis it showed my payments were going to increase again to {$600.00} a month. I called Shellpoint again and questioned why it was going to increase more when there was a refund made for the double payment of my insurance and I hadn't even made a payment of {$590.00} yet. I was told by the representative that is just the what it would be if I wanted to stay current on my mortgage payments I would have to pay the amount. I noticed they based the analysis off of the {$590.00} payment that was due in XXXX. I told the representative I hadn't even made a payment for that amount yet and how could a correct analysis be done based off of a payment I hadn't made. I questioned the amount to be paid in XXXX because it wasn't the right amount. The representative told me after reviewing the analysis from XXXX Shellpoint forgot to apply a {$15.00} charge and that is why my monthly payments where going to increase again in XXXX. I asked that a new escrow analysis be done based off of the {$520.00} amount I had been making for the year of 2024. The representative told me the analysis would be done on XX/XX/XXXX and someone would call me from Shellpoint to go over it with me since there had been so many problems with my account. I never received another escrow analysis, nothing was updated online and no one had called me. I again called Shellpoint to find out what was-going on with my account because the XXXX payment of {$590.00} was due on the XXXX. I was told by the representative that the escrow analysis request was in their system but now would be done by XX/XX/XXXX. I questioned the amount of the XXXX payment because it wasn't correct. It was based off of the shortage when the insurance was double paid by Shellpoint. The representative told me I would have to pay the {$590.00} to stay current on my mortgage payments. She told me that I have a grace period and could wait until the XXXX to review the new analysis without any penalties. I asked if someone would contact me to go over the analysis still. The representative told me that they don't contact people about their analysis. I explained to her the last person I spoke to told me someone would contact me. She apologized that I was misinformed. I asked about the insurance coverage in XXXX. The representative told me that it has been removed from my account because they received verification from my insurance company. 
I still haven't received the escrow analysis I requested because of the double payment of insurance and the calculations being based off of a payment that wasn't made until XX/XX/year>. I have made the payment for XXXX of {$590.00}. I know this amount isn't correct. I will now have to pay {$600.00} in XXXX. I would like for a correct analysis to be done and the opportunity to pay the shortage. I have considered paying the shortage on the XX/XX/XXXX analysis but I know it isn't correct either. 
I have been yelled at, talked over, told that is just how it is, misinformed and lied to by Shellpoint when I call them. I can't seem to get help when calling Shellpoint or anything resolved.

11/12/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I went to Ornate Skin 's booth at the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> and was going to make a purchase for skin case products however wanted to cancel my transaction right away. The employee I was working with while at the booth confirmed the charge was canceled and stated it was okay as I asked right away and I walked away without any of their products as I did not purchase them and saw they had placed the items back on display. 

When I checked my Citi credit card account at a later time, I noticed that the purchase was processed and I filed a dispute to the best of my knowledge from the options given on their website app on XX/XX/year>. Citi began their dispute process and I made multiple calls for follow up on the case status and obtain further guidance as I wanted to ensure Citi knew I did not receive any products, therefore I shouldn't have to pay the charged {$330.00}. The representatives from Citi told me to reach out to the vendor for a resolution to my case as it XXXX be the easiest path. 

I followed their guidance and reached out to the vendor XXXX XXXXn via email between XX/XX/year> - XX/XX/year> who stated they have been assured by their employees that I had received their products, and asked if I could speak with them over the phone to review the products I had supposedly obtained. I did not feel comfortable engaging further as I wanted to have conversations written in writing versus having a verbal conversation reviewing items, as it did not make sense to have a conversation about items that are non-existent. I was never provided from the vendor any details about a cancelation policy, and found it confusing as the employee confirmed the cancelation. 

In addition, the vendor XXXX XXXX seems to make quick errors as they sent me a confirmation of registering a device through them called "" XXXX XXXX '' which costs around $ XXXX to my recollection. I was introduced to the device and provided with an explanation, but I did not agree to make a purchase and was sent a lifetime warranty for a purchase I never made. 

I called Citi once again to obtain further guidance and was advised not to reach out to the vendor if I feel uncomfortable and they would handle it for me. Upon review, the representative stated I had filed incorrectly that it was a "" cancelation '' when it should have been "" non receipt of goods ''. I stated I filled out the form to the best of my knowledge as the verbiage was confusing with the representative agreeing with me. I have attached the options for Citi 's dispute process and to the best of my knowledge I chose "" I have canceled or attempted to cancel this transaction for goods/services from this merchant '' as it made more sense than choosing the supposed appropriate option "" I ordered XXXX services from the merchant but I never received the goods/services '' as I didn't order the goods online and was there in person. The Citi representative stated he would rectify the situation and place it into the appropriate category and it should be resolved very quickly as it is a simple case of not receiving the items. 

I was notified on XX/XX/year> that my case was closed with Citi and my credit would be reversed. I was given an option to appeal the decision and I had made another call to fully understand the situation and was guided to write my statement of what occurred which I completed on XX/XX/year>. 

On XX/XX/year> I received a letter from Citi stating I did not fulfill the cancelation proof, however I didn't understand how I was supposed to obtain it if the vendor wasn't providing it to me and Citi stated the vendor was not responding to their request as well. 
If the vendor does not provide the evidence to Citi, how is a customer supposed to provide that? I kept asking each Citi representative for help as I needed protection from a vendor that is lying as it was a large amount of money to lose for not receiving any items. The Citi representative stated they would try again to open my case and ask to investigate my case. 

On XX/XX/year> Citi sent another letter stating the debits and credits to my account. I was confused with this letter and thought it was a latter stating facts and continued to wait. 

I called Citi XX/XX/year> and was told that my case was closed as I did not provide sufficient evidence of cancelation. I reiterated again that I could not provide evidence as I could not obtain it after requesting it from the vendor with Citi stating they could not obtain it either. I asked the representative if Citi could not obtain the evidence, how could I? Citi then told me that there was nothing that could be done as they went through their investigations. I stated it did not make sense why they were giving me such a hard time when I always pay off my purchases unless I did not receive the product as it was in this case. I should not have to pay for a product I did not receive. The Citi rep then stated she could only reopen my case in XXXX circumstance and proceeded to ask me questions as if I was supposed to know the right answer. To my understanding, I gave the wrong answer as I did not fully understand the technical verbiage they were using. I then got another run around as to why I can not reopen a dispute as their investigators did their job and because I had failed to provide supporting evidence, my case was closed. I reiterated I did not receive the product, therefore I should not have to pay. The Citi representative was very rude and the conversation escalated so I requested to speak with her supervisor. When speaking with the Citi supervisor, she was rude as well and stating incorrect facts about my case upon which I was trying to providing clarification however was unable to do so as she refused to listen and kept talking over me which further escalated the situation. For example, the supervisor stated the investigators were currently working on my case which was not true as the representative stated my case was closed and no action is being taken as there is no solution to my case. The Citi supervisor continued to speak over me which again increased the conflict and then hung up on me. 

After the phone call, I filed a complaint to Citi regarding the matter and received a phone call on XX/XX/year>. The representative stated he reviewed my case, listened to all the phone calls between myself and various Citi representatives, and apologized for the poor management of both representative and supervisor on XX/XX/year>. He then stated there was nothing that can be done to get my refund back as I had filed it under a cancellation versus non receipt of goods. He added that there was no response from the vendor after their initial attempt to contact, therefore the responsibility is upon me to provide evidence. I stated the vendor had confirmed my transaction was canceled and I walked away from the booth after they had said it was and did not take any products with me. In addition, the vendor had sent me another email with a product that costs about {$3000.00} - {$4000.00} thanking me for the purchase when I did not authorize it. The Citi representative continued to state that my case was filed under the wrong category as cancellation when it should have been non receipt of goods, and apologized that the other multiple representatives had provided me the wrong information. I stated I thought they had transferred my case from cancellation to non receipt of goods in my previous call, and received the response that because my transaction has been done in person it didn't matter which option I chose to file it under as I would have lost either way as they are dealing with XXXX and XXXX policies. I stated I can not understand how I can't get a refund of my money when I did not receive any goods. The representative stated he knew I wasn't comfortable with speaking to the vendors anymore however advised the only option was for me to reach out once more to the vendor to see if I could get a refund. I responded I did not feel comfortable as they have already swindled me out of my money and I do not wish to speak with them anymore. I asked if there was anything else I could do and received the answer that there is nothing I could do to get my money back, and I lost the money. They stated they can not submit another case as they already placed it under the cancelation category and can only be submitted once to the vendor. I asked why they couldn't open a case as it was filed under the wrong category as XXXX of the Citi representatives I had spoken with in the past stated they had moved it to the appropriate category of non receipt of goods. I was given a response that unfortunately I was provided with inaccurate information by multiple representatives I spoke with. I added I should not be penalized for multiple Citi reps telling me inaccurate information, and stated the verbiage used was very confusing with the Citi rep agreeing and adding the letter from Citi dated XX/XX/year> is confusing and does not provide any details. 

He apologized that I was given the wrong information and there was nothing I could do to get my money back as both the vendor and I can not show proof that I did not receive the goods or the transaction was canceled. I asked how either party would be able to show evidence and he stated he was not sure. I asked then, why is it that the vendor has so much power when they are swindling me out of my money without anything to show for it, with the representative stating that they aren't protecting the vendor but following policies. He then confirmed and stated there is nothing else I could do and that there was no other entity that was above him or his department that could assist me after the call placed on XX/XX/year>. 

I have exhausted all means to rectify this situation and in dire need of help and protection. If I could please get assistance with getting my money back I would greatly appreciate it as again, I do not have any items in my possession for the {$330.00} paid. I never dispute a charge unless I didn't receive the product and hope someone can help me as I am being taken advantage of. I have also reported the vendor XXXX XXXX to the FTC, and thanks to the professional guidance from CFPB I will be reporting it to other agencies in hopes that no one else will be swindled by this company as I have.

i was never mailed the last bill, i attempted to log on the account so i can pay for it but my login was already closed only within 20 days of going to another company. 

I was immediately sent to a collections agency, which i disputed because the amount was higher than i owed and upon reading the details. they added the phone charge which i returned.

It was then sent to another collections. XXXX XXXX XXXX, who i made an agreement with since the payoff amount was close to what i believed i owed with the agreement that they will not hurt my credit. 

They immediately sent a revised bill ( attached ) in XX/XX/year> with the amount now doubled at {$530.00}. even at my displeasure with this terrible tactic i decided to settle with them by giving them my credit card number over the phone to charge just so they can go away. months later i called them because i realized that they did not charge my card and was told that that the debt is no longer in their system.

These inaccuracies have unjustly impacted my credit score, and I am compelled to request their immediate rectification in accordance with federal regulations. 

Upon reviewing my credit report, I identified late payment inquiries that are erroneously reported. These inaccuracies stem from incorrect reporting of payment status. Consequently, I urge you to expeditiously remove these inaccuracies from my credit report to rectify the harm inflicted on my financial reputation. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., empowers consumers to dispute any inaccuracies on their credit reports. Under the FCRA, both credit reporting agencies ( CRAs ) and furnishers of information, such as your entity, are mandated to ensure the accuracy and completeness of all reported information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Moreover, the FCRA obligates CRAs and information furnishers to conduct a thorough investigation of disputes and to delete or correct any inaccuracies within a reasonable timeframe, not exceeding 30 days ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ). Non-compliance with these provisions may result in liability for damages, including attorney 's fees ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ). 

Additionally, the FCRA prohibits the reporting of outdated information. Specifically, it mandates the removal of any adverse information, including late payments, that predates the seven-year threshold, measured from the date of the initial delinquency ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 5 ) ). 

In light of the above, I formally request the immediate removal of the disputed late payment inquiries from my credit report. I also expect written confirmation of this removal within 10 days of your receipt of this letter. Failure to address this dispute promptly will compel me to take further action, including but not limited to, monitoring my credit report closely and seeking legal remedies as afforded by the FCRA. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and expect your cooperation in resolving this dispute in a manner that upholds the integrity of my credit report and complies with the FCRA.

Transunion has prevented this and I can only call them to have this done, which is an inconvenience when it maybe needed after business hours!! I had to call free annual credit report and request them mail me a copy of my credit report! I have received notices of several data breaches and that ALL of my personal information including my Social Security number is on the Dark Web! 

I also am writing to formally dispute several inaccuracies on my credit report, including unauthorized inquiries, improperly reported bankruptcies, and accounts listed with derogatory status despite their inclusion in bankruptcy discharge. Please consider this correspondence as a request to investigate, correct, and remove these erroneous items under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq. in accordance with my rights.

Despite my previous attempts to dispute these inaccuracies, they remain uncorrected and unverified. It is essential that these errors are addressed promptly to comply with FCRA accuracy requirements. 

XXXX. Unauthorized Credit Inquiries The following credit inquiries appear on my report without my authorization. I neither requested nor provided consent for these inquiries : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX These inquiries were unauthorized and, as such, violate FCRA provisions regarding permissible purposes for credit inquiries ( 15 U.S.C. 1681b ). I request that these inquiries be removed from my credit report as they were not initiated by me or any action of mine. If the furnisher believes these inquiries are valid, I request documentation showing my explicit consent for each inquiry.

2. Improper Reporting of Bankruptcies My credit report incorrectly reflects two bankruptcy cases that the court confirmed should not be reported to credit bureaus. In particular : XXXX. XXXX XXXX Bankruptcy - XX/XX/XXXX, listed as Dismissed with a {$0.00} balance. 
XXXX. XXXX  XXXX Bankruptcy - XX/XX/XXXX, listed as Discharged with a {$0.00} balance. 

Per the courts confirmation, they do not report these cases to credit bureaus. Additionally, Under the FCRA, this inaccurate reporting causes undue harm to my creditworthiness. I request an immediate correction and removal of any reference to these cases. 

XXXX. Accounts Improperly Listed as Derogatory Despite Bankruptcy Discharge I have identified certain accounts on my report that continue to be listed as derogatory, even though they were included and subsequently discharged in bankruptcy. Reporting derogatory status, or delinquent payments on discharged debts contravenes FCRA accuracy requirements ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) and FDCPA protections. I request an investigation and prompt removal of any delinquent designations on accounts included in my bankruptcy.

Please complete your investigation within the 30-day statutory timeframe and provide a corrected credit report reflecting the removal of these inaccuracies. For each disputed item, I request all relevant information used to verify the accuracy of the entry, including any documentation proving that I consented to each of the inquiries. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to these matters. I trust that these errors will be corrected to ensure compliance with the FCRA and uphold the integrity of my credit report.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) This law provides the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information on credit reports. Since these accounts are fraudulent, they must be removed to maintain the accuracy of my report.

2. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) This law protects consumers from fraudulent debt collection practices. As these accounts were not authorized by me, any collection efforts violate the FDCPA and should cease immediately. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB and the credit bureaus take immediate action to investigate and remove these fraudulent accounts from my credit report to reflect my true financial standing.

11/12/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card,"XX/XX/XXXX Attention : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Barclays XXXX XXXX [ undisclosed last name ] Thank you for your letter of XX/XX/XXXX. As I am not able to reach you by telephone, I am responding via the CFPB XXXX. I think that a further conversation may help us to understand one another. 

Regretfully, neither your above-referenced letter, nor its attached letter of XX/XX/XXXX, resolve the XXXX-year-long dispute. 

The issue, first reported on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, is an overcharge in the amount {$280.00}. I never claimed that the merchant altered the amount charged on my account, as Barclays incorrectly alleges in its XX/XX/XXXX letter. More than once, I provided Barclays with the merchants own receipt of payment in the amount of {$13000.00}. I am now attaching e-mail correspondence with the merchant wherein the merchant states that on XX/XX/XXXX, it received payment of XXXX {$13000.00} ( calculated at an exchange rate XXXX XXXX $ XXXX ). Barclays, on the other hand, charged my account {$13000.00}. I should mention that Barclays separately charged me a foreign transaction fee, so this overcharge is not a foreign transaction fee. 

Barclays claims to have resolved the claim in my favor, because it did the following without my authorization : As per the merchant, Barclays contacted the merchant, reversed its original XX/XX/XXXX payment to the merchant in the amount of {$13000.00}, and then paid the merchant {$13000.00}. Meanwhile, I had paid Barclays {$13000.00}, as Barclays acknowledges in its XX/XX/XXXX letter. The credit Barclays claims to have provided basically allows for the charge on my account to be {$13000.00} ( what I paid ) instead of Barclays original charge on the account of {$13000.00}. However, since Barclays received {$13000.00} from me and subsequently reversed and paid the merchant about {$13000.00}, Barclays continues to overcharge me. It then suggests, as you do again now, that I bring up the matter with the merchant, attempting to distance Barclays from the dispute. Yet, from my perspective as a client, the unanswered question persists : Why does Barclays pay a merchant XXXX amount and charge its client a higher amount? 

If customer service is very important to Barclays and if it honestly regret [ XXXX ] the hardship it continues to impose upon me, as expressed in some of its letters, then Barclays should be transparent about the transaction and the overcharge.

1681. This eviction listing is incorrect, unlawful, and outdated, and it is harming my creditworthiness.

As per my rights under the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i, you are required to investigate and correct any inaccurate or incomplete information on my credit report within 30 days. I request that you remove this erroneous eviction entry immediately, as it violates the following provisions : Inaccurate Information : The eviction record you are reporting is either erroneous or incomplete.

It is critical that all information listed on my credit report is both accurate and verifiable. If the eviction record can not be verified by the landlord or property manager, it must be removed from my report as a matter of law. 
2. Failure to Provide Complete Verification : Under the FCRA, any information that is not adequately verified or substantiated by documentation must be removed from the credit report. I request you provide detailed proof that this eviction record has been thoroughly verified according to the law, including any signed contracts, eviction judgments, or other relevant documentation.

3. Outdated Information : If this eviction is over seven years old, it is a violation of the FCRAs time limitations. 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 1 ) explicitly prohibits reporting of negative information older than seven years. If the eviction entry falls outside of this window, it must be deleted immediately.

As you are well aware, failure to comply with the FCRA may result in legal action, including but not limited to claims for damages, statutory penalties, and attorney fees under 15 U.S.C.

1681n and 1681o. I have kept records of all relevant communications and documentation regarding this matter, and I will not hesitate to take further action to protect my rights.

Please remove this eviction from my credit report within the legally mandated 30-day investigation period. If you fail to do so, I will escalate this matter by filing complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), and my states attorney generals office.

11/20/2024,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Repossession,Lender trying to repossess or disable the vehicle,"Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles It is with a XXXX XXXXXXXX that I share this experience, as integrity means everything to me. I had high expectations from a reputable dealership, I considered family when I purchased a vehicle from them on XX/XX/year>. The next day, I drove it from XXXX to XXXX. Later that afternoon, I noticed a large amount of oil had leaked onto the concrete where the car was parked. Knowing my parking space was clean before, I immediately documented the issue with photos and reached out to the dealerships general manager, sales manager, and salesperson on Monday.

To my surprise, the general manager admitted that he was aware of the oil leak. As someone familiar with carsmy father is a mechanicI know that oil is essential for an engines health, just like blood is to a body. When I asked why the issue wasnt resolved before selling it to me, especially given our supposed family bond, he replied that he didnt think it was worth fixing for the price. This response was deeply disappointing, and I was left to address a problem I hadnt created. 
As if this wasnt bad enough, I also discovered roaches in the car, which intensified my frustration and XXXX. When I shared this with the general manager, he advised me to use foggers to solve the issue, as if it were a minor inconvenience. Given our historyhe had previously resolved a minor oil leak on a vehicle I purchased in XXXX was shocked by his dismissive attitude this time around. 
Since that day, Ive been back and forth with XXXX XXXX in XXXX, pleading with them to take the vehicle back and resolve the situation by providing an alternate truck. I even offered to return it, but circumstances beyond my control, including two hurricanes and financial constraints, prevented me from making the trip. Eventually, I found a local mechanic who examined the vehicle and concluded that the issue was too severe and should NEVER have been sold to me in the first place. 
On XX/XX/year>, I took the vehicle to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, where the team, including General XXXX XXXX, Service Advisor XXXX, and Service XXXX XXXX, went above and beyond to help. Despite not being responsible for this sale, they treated my situation with the urgency and respect I had hoped for from the original dealership. Lead Service Mechanic XXXX discovered the oil leak had not only damaged wires but also flooded the vehicles entire computer system, making the car unsafe to drive.

Throughout this ordeal, I have repeatedly asked the original dealership to retrieve the car, acknowledging it as a lemon, but they have refused. I contacted my insurance company, ( XXXX XXXX ) made a claim, and notified my lender ( First Investors ) that I am unwilling to pay for a defective vehicle. I am exhausted from fighting this battle and simply want the situation rectified! 
Due to the delays in obtaining title documentation from XXXX XXXX, I am now on my SECOND temporary tag, which is about to expire, and I suspect the car wont pass Georgias emissions test. The oil has literally flooded the wires and the trucks computer system!! The check engine and oil light are constantly on!! This isnt a regular oil leak!! The XXXX general manager offered to split the costs with me to fix the vehicle, a solution I find unreasonable as the issue was pre-existing. When he said, Its just a car, XXXX, I felt utterly dismissed. This car is unsafe and infested, and I deserve better treatment. XXXX XXXX has CONSISTENTLY reached XXXX XXXX XXXX with no resolve to date. **Do not call me, answer the General Manager 's call!! 
XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX has shown me there are still people/businesses who uphold integrity in this industry. They have consistently prioritized my safety, even prohibiting me from driving the car due to its dangerous condition. I never wanted to make this situation public, but I can no longer tolerate being strung along by the dealership in XXXX, which has failed to make things right. This has impacted my financial stability, and all I seek is fairness. I have reached out to the automotive group that owns the XXXX dealership ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), only to be told that the XXXX XXXX would be handling the situation. Nothing! Absolutely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ive submitted this information briefly to journalists in both XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) via XXXX. 
My goal is NOT to ruin anyones career ( as everyone needs to provide for their family ), but simply to have this situation resolved in a way that restores my faith in this business and in basic decency!! Someone had to inspect the car, sign off on the inspection of the car in order to ensure that it was SAFE and fit for sale!! I believe that had I not had to drive home to Georgia, the oil situation wouldve presented itself down the line, they werent banking on it happening as soon as fast as it happened!! XXXX XX/XX/XXXX!! The insurance adjuster has received the information as of XX/XX/year> and will investigate the truck!! The video is just a snippet!!

Shellpoint Mortgage had the number of my mailing address wrong so I did not receive documentation to tell me that my loan was transferred. They also had my phone number wrong, so I did not receive any calls if they were made. I called XXXX XXXX bc my payments werent coming out automatically and I was concerned. They informed me that the loan was transferred to Shellpoint and they would reach out to me by mail and/or email. I did finally receive an email from shellpoint in XXXX, I tried to access my account online as suggested but they required an account number. I didnt know what my account number was bc I never received anything in the mail with that information. Therefore I was never able to complete the online process or even get past the first online screen. I received my first my letter from Shellpoint stating I needed to pay XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX at the end of XXXX. This is how I noticed that my address was not correct but at least I now had an account number on that letter so I was able to actually access my account online. I tried to log in and make a payment but I was only given the options to either request a refinance or apply for some type hardship. I was not allowed to make a payment bc of how far behind I was. I sent them an email through that website explaining that I want to submit payment but I ended up applying for a hardship only bc it was the only option besides refinancing and I was hoping that it would take me to a payment page since those were the only options provided but I actually did have the payment of XXXX. No one responded. No email and no phone call. I did changed my phone number and my address online through their website bc if they were trying to reach me, they had the wrong information. I gave it a few days and then submitted payment directly from my bank since I finally had the information necessary to actually submit a payment and my anxiety was through roof at this point and I was not getting a response ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account ) confirmation # XXXX in the amount of XXXX ( the total amount past due ). I emailed them again through their website letting them know payment was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and explaining what happened. All my previous emails were still in the inbox stating pending review. When I logged on again later that day to check to see if i received any response or if the email statuses had changed at least, as soon as I logged in a red error-type message appeared stating my account was in legal status. I have not received any foreclosure documents, I have not been served and I have been trying to make payments but no one has responded to me. This is an unfair practice. My mailing address and my phone # were not even accurate. Im not sure what else I was supposed to do to make payments. I took the extra step to send payment directly from my bank to them bc that was the only thing I could think to do since no one has responded to me. Any help you could provide would be appreciated.

My account was closed by the bank, with the stated reason being "" fraud activity '' due to "" high spending '' within a single month. However, I believe this action was inappropriate and unjustified, as my spending activity was legitimate and aligned with the purpose of opening the card. 
The spending flagged as fraudulent occurred during a recent family trip, where I used the card as intended to cover various travel-related expenses, including accommodations, dining, and entertainment. I opened this card with the specific intent to use it for family expenses and expected that such usage would be within the banks acceptable range, especially given my established credit history. 
When I contacted Citi regarding this issue, I explained the nature of these charges, but I was still informed that the account closure was final. This action has been highly inconvenient and disruptive, as I have been left without access to the card that I expected to use during my travels. 
I am requesting the CFPB to investigate this matter and urge Citi to reconsider their decision. This experience has caused significant frustration, and I am concerned about the impact of this action on my credit score.

This notice states that your claim is disputed and validation of the account is required. 

This notice is not a request for verification of the account or proof of my mailing address but a request for validation made pursuant to the F.D.C.P.A. laws. I humbly request that your agency/ office sends me valid proof of claim that I am legally obligated to pay you. 

Please provide me with the below mentioned items : * Evidence that the debt has not been discharged * Evidence that this debt has not been disputed * An explanation showing me how you have computed the amount.

* Copies of any original wet ink signature documents that prove I agreed to pay the alleged amount * The identity of the original creditor * Proof that the original creditor has assigned you security interest as the holder in due course * Evidence that you are a licensed debt collector * Evidence of your license numbers and your registered agent. 

I would like to inform you that in case your agency has reported invalidated account information to any of the three main credit bureaus such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, then it will be regarded as a fraudulent action under both federal and state statutes. Due to this reason, if any negative item is reported to any of my credit reports by your agency or the agency that you represent, then I will be compelled to take legal steps against you for the below mentioned reasons : * Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( F.C.R.A. ) * Violation of the F.D.C.P.A. 
* Defamation of character * Use of my copyrighted property I would like to further inform you that if any action is taken during the validation period which could be regarded as detrimental to any of my credit reports, then I will seek advice about initiating a potential lawsuit. This includes listing any information on a credit report that could be incorrect or invalidated, or confirming an account as correct when, in fact, there is no provided evidence that it is. 

If your agency can provide me with the requested documents, I will need a minimum of thirty ( 30 ) days to investigate this information, and during this period of time, all collection activities must be stopped. 

Also, I request that you provide evidence that I must pay you in anything other than appropriate commercial paper should the debt be proven valid because, to my knowledge, the U.S. Congress provided the appropriate remedy for me to settle my debts via the remedy in House Joint Resolution ( H.J.R. ) 192 of XX/XX/XXXX under the United States, Public Law 73-10, and Public Law 48 stat. 112 ( among others ).

If your agency/ company fails to respond to this debt validation request within a period of ten ( 10 ) days from the date of your receipt of my notice and affidavit, then the account information must be completely deleted from my credit report, and a copy of such deletion request should be sent to me at once, or I will take legal action. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no calls should be made by your agency or company at my residence or workplace. If your agency attempts to make unlimited or computer generated calls to me or any third parties, then it will be considered harassment, and I will have no option but to file a lawsuit. All future communications with me should be done in writing and sent to the address mentioned in this letter. Further, any correspondence must be made in the form of a commercial affidavit under penalty of perjury and sent by certified mail. Any other form of service shall be deemed defective upon its face. 

It would be advisable that you assure that your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action. This is an attempt to correct your records. Any information obtained shall be used for that purpose.

11/4/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"The credit card company, Care Credit, has created schemes to fraudulently overcharge its customers with high interest rates and fees. Care Credit is primarily used to pay dentist bills. The company initially offers a plan with an APR interest, credit limit, late fee, and deferred interest due date. It appears to be a normal credit card at first. However, when the account is actually charged, the deal changes each time at the point of sale. A new deal is generated with a different interest rate and due date. At the point of sale, the customer can not see the new deal and is unaware of the changes. Employees at dentist offices charge Care Credit accounts without informing their patients about the new deal. The employees simply print out a receipt for the patient without an explanation. The dental staff unknowingly participate in Care Credits fraud. In turn, most customers are unaware that the deal has changed and eventually get caught up in significantly high interest charges. Care Credit starts calculating interest at the point of sale. The company offers a deferred interest rate for a specific time then adds all the calculated interest to the customers monthly statement the second a charge is late. For example, whenever a charge is deferred for XXXX months, Care Credit will bill for the full XXXX months of interest, if the charge is not paid-in-full within XXXX months. No matter how much money has been paid toward the initial charge. And, usually the interest is extremely high, around 29.99 % +. Care Credits fraud takes place each time the card is used. Care Credit changes the due date and interest rate for each deal at the point of sale to confuse its customers who are dealing with dental issues. Most people who use this card do not have law school degrees and are taken advantage of repeatedly. Care Credit floods its customers with email schemes to entice its victims into charging more. When the card is not being used often, Care Credit repeatedly sends offers promising statement credits when large purchases are made. They have sent offers for chances to win a {$5000.00} XXXX XXXX with {$500.00} Weekly Winners and other Sweepstakes. Care Credit uses gambling tactics to lure their victims into spending more to Earn More Entries! Care Credit has never sent emails about the changes to their interest rates, due dates, etc. Care Credits deceitful activities should be deemed illegal. My own experience with Care Credit started in XX/XX/XXXX. The office manager described Care Credit as insurance and created an account for me on her computer. I could not see her computer screen nor what she was typing. She did not inform me of what she was reading or approving while she created my account. She simply wrote down my account number on a sticky note and said I had 6 months to pay off all charges. I knew nothing else about Care Credit nor its policies and simply used my Care Credit account number that was stored on their computer each time I visited. I thought Care Credit was connected somehow. I recently was informed about Care Credits schemes. I called the company and, for the first time, was told that I had nearly {$300.00} of interest that had accumulated within several months.

This situation raises significant concerns regarding compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

According to the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, a furnisher of information, such as a collection agency, is required to provide accurate information to credit reporting agencies. Additionally, 1681i mandates that consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports. 

In this instance, the collection agency reported a debt that they have classified as a "" loss '' for tax purposes. This classification suggests that they have written off the debt, which raises questions about the legitimacy of their ongoing reporting of this account on my credit report. The continued presence of this account is not only misleading but also detrimental to my creditworthiness. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue directly with [ Agency of credit control ] but have not received a satisfactory response. I also requested a copy of schedule c again no response Therefore, I am reaching out to the CFPB for assistance in enforcing my rights under the FCRA.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Agency of Credit Control,CA,92262,None,Consent provided,Web,11/18/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10872346

I then found around XXXX that night that she had locked my account, preventing me from using my debit card or accessing my online banking. 

I tried calling on both Sunday the XXXX and Monday the XXXX, but I could not reach anyone as this was a holiday weekend. When I finally reached someone on the XXXX, I was once again advised that I can not be verified via my phone number despite it being present in the system, and I was instead attempted to be verified with a quiz that was drawn from public record. This quiz involved questions pertaining to individuals who share my last name that I have no relation to or knowledge of.

After opening the account, I deposited checks via mobile check deposit, waited for them to clear, and then used XXXX to transfer money to my wifes account since I have not yet received a debit card and there are no Citi branches in my area. 

Initially, there were no issues with these transactions. However, after receiving a XXXX payment of {$650.00}, I sent {$310.00} from that amount to cover a bill. While Citi shows the transaction as completed, the funds never arrived in my wifes account. As I tried to resolve this issue, I suddenly lost access to my online account and was instructed to call the fraud department. 

When I contacted the fraud department, I experienced extremely poor customer service. Representatives were dismissive, unhelpful, and even mocking. Despite my ability to verify my Social Security number, drivers license number, and other personal information, I was unable to verify my debit card number because I have not yet received it. This is precisely why I had been relying on XXXX for transfers, all within the allowable limits. 

Additionally, Citi informed me that they could not verify my phone number, even though it is registered in my name through XXXX XXXX XXXX and was the number I used to sign up for the account. They also claimed my email address couldnt be verified, despite the fact that I received fraud alerts at this same email and used it when opening the account. 

As a result, I was told that I would have to wait up to XXXX business days to receive a code in the mail to regain access to my account. This delay is unacceptable, as I urgently need access to my funds. The situation has caused significant financial hardship and disrupted my ability to manage essential expenses.

11/18/2024,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I purchased a XXXX Spa treatment plan from XXXX ( Parent Company : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX ( according to the debt collector Midwest Fidelity ). I was told XXXX does not handle their financial collections in-house but through XXXX  XXXX  ( at the time ) and they were going to set me up on a payment plan, but I was told that I could pay it off in full or in larger sums if I wanted to. I had my first appointment on XX/XX/XXXX and decided I wanted to pay the treatments off in full so I didn't have to worry about making payments so I called Ally Lending on XX/XX/XXXX and made the full payment over the phone for {$4700.00}. I have documentation in my bank statements of this payment to this company. I continued to receive mail from this lending service, saying that I still owed the full amount and was being charged interest. So I called XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX telling them about the mail and after providing documentation, I assumed the matter was resolved. I continued to receive the same debt mail from this lending company for months after, but I didn't think anything of it and thought they were sending it to me by accident because I 1. had already paid, and 2. I called them to resolve the issue and they said it was resolved. Now it is XX/XX/XXXX and I am receiving calls from Midwest Fidelity debt collectors saying that I still owe the {$4700.00} and they have no documentation of me ever paying. So now I am trying to resolve this all over again by giving them a copy of my bank statement showing that I paid the full amount almost 2 years ago. I just checked my credit score and this specific issue has dropped my score well over XXXX points ( I previously had an almost perfect score ). This has been an absolute nightmare and not only am I having to deal with the tedious task of getting this resolved. I also have to prove that I've been falsely reported for debt with creditors so I can attempt to fix my credit score.

11/19/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"I have a savings account with Citi bank that I opened online. Citi does not have branches in my state ( Utah ), but are very willing to open accounts and house my money. I do not remember setting up a security word for calling into the bank for help and I did not set up a debit card for the account. This is a savings account, so it doesn't need to use a debit card. 

I have since stopped using the account and have taken the money out. I'm now getting told that my account will be charged a maintenance fee because it has less than the required deposit amount set by the bank. This should not be a problem because I want to close the account anyway. 

The problem is that account can not be closed online. Accounts can only be closed with customer service on the phone. When I call they will not allow me to close the account without my debit card number or my security word. I can do all kinds of things with the account, but I can not close it. I can verify my address, provide my social security number, and the account information to verify my identity, but the only way to close the account is to give them the security word that I do not know. 

To close my account I have to visit a branch outside of my state to verify my identity. This is unacceptable to me and is a scam!

11/21/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I filed a dispute with my bank for merchandise that was purchased from bestbuy.com for the amount charged to my card of {$520.00}. 

Wells Fargo investigated the charge and they determined they sided with XXXX XXXX stating the product was delivered. I disagreed with the dispute resolution because I did not receive the product. I was not home at the the time the package was delivered. They stated per terms and conditions of XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo has to abide by their conditions and I told them no that is not correct. You guys don't need to follow any of their terms and conditions specially if they were at fault. If this is the case than you are not allowing for consumers to dispute items that were never delivered and actually prevents customers from disputing charges for items that were never delivered. Just because an item is delivered does not mean it arrived to the receiver of the purchase. 

In this case the laptop was never delivered to me because I was not home at the time the delivery was made. The package required my signature and XXXX did not get my signature. All they did was write my name on the tracking information. XXXX XXXX would not work with me on this either. ( I will file another CFPB complaint with XXXX XXXX ) They continued to ignore my side of the story and never got the chance for me to rebuttal XXXX XXXX claims. Wells fargo just sided with them and ignored my evidence. This is not only wrong but it might be illegal as I have a right to dispute the charge and I have a right to defend my dispute. Wells fargo did not give me that right to defend it. I have a right to get my money back from this as I never received it. I have a good amount of evidence showing I was not home. This includes witnesses as I was attending a family member due to her broken elbow. 

Overall I am filing a complaint as this is not only not fair but illegal if I am not able to contest findings and I feel that I deserve to get my money back from it but instead Wells Fargo refuses. 

I also attempted to dispute unauthorize charges and instead they closed my accounts so now I am out with more money.

11/13/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I contacted Barclay yesterday in regards to the previous complaint. I let them know that I saw the response in regards to the letter on XX/XX/XXXX, and that the response was incorrect. Barclays fraud department, supervisor team, customer service team, and finance team, are all aware that there have been clerical errors in regards to them, charging the credits that were due back to me, and that in regards to conversations stating that they had completed everything in XX/XX/XXXX was incorrect. I was working with XXXX, and he had provided additional statements because there were 4 different cards circulating at the same time, and two of them we were not even aware existed. He also stated that the credits that were due to me in XXXX appeared to be a clerical error where they had charged us instead of credited us. I was on the phone with Barclay for over XXXX XXXX hours yesterday trying to get the fraud department and the supervisors to address the situation in regards to the fact that not only are we owed credit that was not done by the fraud department, but they had also taken money out of our bank account as a payment, instead of crediting the money back to our account. I explained to the manager last night that the fraud department had been so rude to me in my recorded conversation with them that the customer service rep that forwarded me to her, cried on the phone at the way that I had been treated by that department. Sadly, the supervisor was just as rude and ended up hanging up on me in regards to the fact that not only did they still owe me credits for the fraud that they had approved entirely by the details that we supplied to them as they stated in the enclosed letter that they sent to you, but they had not issued those credits and they had not refunded the money that they accidentally withdrew from our checking account instead of giving us a refund. I can only state that I assume the supervisor hung up on me because no one attempted to call me back and no one was available when I tried to call back. When I called back today in regards to speaking with someone or trying to get a phone number for their executive offices my call was disconnected again. This company owes me over {$50000.00}. Due to clerical errors and credits they havent issued. As supplied by them in my formal complaint they indeed agreed that everything was awarded in our favor. I appreciate you supplying me a copy of that letter because we never received it in the mail and no one stated that that had been done. That being said, the only issue that needs to be rectified at this point are the additional credits that need to be handled due to the clerical errors in their financial department. This company also closed my card after almost a decade of being a loyal customer that was never late on a single payment. I need any assistance whatsoever to get these funds returned to us. We did receive our current statement in the mail today, but it states that we owe them XXXX dollars instead of the fact that they owe us almost {$50000.00}. I dont know what to do at this point, and I need any phone numbers and any organization numbers and any information that I can get to get this escalated to someone within this company thats actually going to care. I was actually told by the fraud department that I needed to mail my statements into their company so they can review them. How can a company not have their own documentation again? The customer service team was extremely polite, and was hit with the same brick wall when she tried to speak to a supervisor in the fraud department. She gave me a different number to call because fraud was refusing to take my phone call. I dont understand how these things can be overlooked and then closed after they claim that everything has been awarded in my favor. I am not disagreeing that they dont owe me a bunch of money. They are just not returning it to me, and then they are refusing to talk to me in regards to the money that they owe me. I dont know. I understand how we can be victimized by financial exploitation and fraud, and then be victimized by the companies that are supposed to be protecting us in the process I dont understand how the companies can then commit financial exploitation themselves by refusing to return your money or refusing to discuss the facts needed for your refund. I have contacted so many departments, looking for someone to assist us, that I dont know who else to call. The only people at that company that are trying to help me are the customer service representatives because they dont understand why their fraud department and their management team are not taking care of the problem that they can clearly see on their end. The customer service representative that I spoke to last night made extensive notes on my account in regards to the money that is owed to me and the fraud department and the supervisor refuse to read a single one, and then I called back to the customer service department to see if their departments were able to see those and they stated that yes they were clearly noted. Every single XXXX was noted that that company owes us. At this point I dont even care if somebody could give me the phone number to the local news station where theyre located at. Maybe if I get a news crew in there and I can make this public and let people know whats going on and let people know that you can be a victim of fraud and that a credit card company can steal your money on top of it too and just close your complaint by stating that they let me know that I won every XXXX back that I requested. Its nice on paper, but it doesnt do me any good when that money is not returned to my bank account. When I XXXX  their company, it says theyre overseas. So if you know what state they actually live in or city they actually live in. I will call the new station. I will fly there and I will go live if thats what its gon na take. I just need someone to help me and I am desperate.

Apparently nobody has said to deal with the amount of financial loss that a company is adding to.

I politely declined his offer and told him that wasnt part of the deal. He also wouldnt accept my XXXX XXXX or my XXXX XXXX  credit cards. He only accepted the Citi bank credit card. He charged my Citi bank credit card a security deposit of {$1500.00}. He told me that when I bring the car back, he would refund my security deposit I brought the car back on XX/XX/year> at XXXX. The same man and a woman were there at the parking lot. After briefly inspecting the car, the woman said that there was a new a damage to the car. I asked her to show me the damage because I couldnt see any damage. She then pointed to a small scratch less than 3 inches on the bottom side of the front bumper. This was very tiny, you have to know exactly where to look for it in order to see it. I told her that this damage wasnt a new damage. Luckily I took a video of the whole car before I checked out the car. I asked the woman to refund the security deposit. She said that ok give me your card. I gave her my card but instead of refunding the security deposit ( {$1500.00} ), she made a new charge on the card in the amount of {$1400.00}. She blatantly lied to me and told me that she was refunding my security deposit but instead made unauthorised charge. When I asked her why she made a charge that I didnt agree to it, she told me that I should make insurance claim. I never agreed to their damage claim. I had a proof that the damage was pre-existing. I immediately went to the police station to report the illegal unauthorised charge. I also immediately called Citi bank customer service and reported the unauthorised charge. They told me that they will open a fraud investigation. I also made claim to the insurance. The insurance asked me to send them the inspection video. The insurance then told me that they would not cover it as this was a pre-existing. Citi bank closed the fraud investigation after a week in favorite of the merchant. I called them and they told me that I gave the merchant my card and I received a service from the merchant. I told them that I didnt not authorise the charge and I paid for the rental car through XXXX website with my XXXX  credit card. I explained to them that the damage theyre claiming was pre-existing and that I had a video to proof it. They then told that they will open a dispute investigation. They closed the dispute on XX/XX/XXXX on favorite of the merchant. They sent me a letter detailing the dispute with the merchants response. After reading it, I was shocked. The merchant didnt prove that I authorised the charge. They just lied and said I accepted responsibility for the damage and gave them my card willingly. They have also contradicted on their response and added my hard written statement which states they are claiming a damage that Im not aware of. I called Citi bank dispute department and told them that they lied on their response letter. I told them that I didnt authorise the charge and that I never accepted their claim of the damage. Citi bank then told me that they will continue the dispute and sent me documents to sign in order to continue the dispute. I signed the document and faxed to them. Meanwhile Citi bank reversed the credit and billed me for this charge although the dispute was still open and not resolved. I called them again and told them that they billed me a charge in which the dispute still ongoing. The lady I spoke with told me that she would send a note to the person who was handling my dispute. But credit was never issued and Citi bank continued to bill me on the disputed charge while it was still unsolved. They mishandled this dispute very bad and I believe they breached their contract by billing me while the dispute was still under investigation. They sent me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX which was dated on XX/XX/XXXX informing me that they closed the dispute, once again in favour of the merchant. This was extremely frustrating. I was very disappointed and lost confidence on Citi bank. I felt like they already decided they were going to rule in favour of the merchant even before the investigation was complete. This impacted me greatly in my mental and physical health. I lost a lot of sleep over this and experienced a lot of stress to the point that I could rest at night. It was very sad because I knew 100 % that these people were scamming me yet I felt helpless because my credit card company failed to properly investigate. I have the evidence that debunks their claim of the damage. This crucial evidence was not even mentioned on the dispute result letter. Even now through the Citi app the dispute is still showing as no resolved although the bill is past due. The due date was XX/XX/year> but it reads 5 days past due as of XX/XX/year>.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",WA,98002,None,Consent provided,Web,11/17/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10828363

FortiFI provided {$77000.00} in financing to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, without adequate assessment or safeguards. This failure to ensure fair practices led to excessive pricing and predatory tactics used by XXXX XXXX, which FortiFI permitted to participate in the PACE program. 
XXXX XXXX applied high-pressure tactics to secure my agreement to the loan from FortiFI, claiming it was necessary for home improvements. FortiFI not only released funds to XXXX without verifying the validity of the assessment but also failed to monitor the transaction to prevent price gouging. Recently, FortiFI issued XXXX checks to me to address overcharges on the assessment, yet this action does not rectify the inflated initial loan amount or mitigate the substantial financial burden I have borne since XXXX, as I have paid taxes and interest on this loan for over five years.

Despite my repeated complaints and the existence of numerous allegations against XXXX, FortiFI has not canceled my loan. On XX/XX/XXXX, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation ( DFPI ) issued a Desist and Refrain Order against XXXX XXXX due to fraudulent activity. Yet, FortiFI has avoided responsibility for failing to properly vet or oversee XXXX practices. In my DFPI complaint dated XX/XX/XXXX, FortiFI acknowledged that XXXX XXXX held a current and active CSLB license. However, despite this, FortiFI allowed XXXX to receive loan funds without officially enrolling them in the PACE program, placing me and others at risk of financial harm. 
Given these factors, I believe FortiFI has failed in its consumer protection obligations and violated my rights as a borrower under several laws, including : California Business and Professions Code 17200 ( Unfair Competition Law - UCL ) Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Act ) I request that the CFPB investigate FortiFIs business practices, particularly their lack of oversight and approval of unjustified charges. I am also requesting that FortiFI cancel my loan entirely to address the financial harm caused by their facilitation of this inflated and predatory transaction.

Shellpoint still had XXXX insurance policies on the books in my account even though the old one was marked expired according to the rep. I was being charged for both policies for the escrow account. The one that ends with XXXX should have been removed. The rep said it could take 30-45 days to re-run the escrow. In the meantime, I should pay my overdue mortgage amount. I told her I couldnt because I didnt have thousands of dollars lying around. 
I asked to speak to a supervisor, who told me his name is XXXX XXXX. He said he would have an expedited run on the escrow, and it would take a week. In the meantime, he recommended that I pay my XXXX mortgage early to prevent getting more threatening letters and calls. He opened up case number XXXX for the matter. He said he also opened up case number XXXX to make sure my credit score wouldnt be affected. 
I called back on XX/XX/year>, more than a week later. It seemed that nothing had been done on my account. I spent a long time on hold with someone in the insurance department who said after a long while that she got the extra insurance removed from my account.

I see on my last statement that I have Total Fees and Charges for {$44.00} and Overdue Payment for {$510.00}. 
The rep also said it would take a couple of weeks to re-run the escrow. It should have been done already per the expedited status I was promised on the XX/XX/XXXX call. I asked to speak to a supervisor again, but I was put on hold for a long time. I had been more than an hour on this call, and I had to hang up and do other things.

11/5/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"This complaint is in regards to Penn Credit Corporation. I was sent an notification about this said debt and I responded to the letter requesting them to validate this said debt. I had until XX/XX/2024 to respond and I responded in the allotted time. The items that I requested were the name and address of the creditor to whom the debt is currently owed, account number used by that creditor. I asked them to provide me a copy of the written agreement that created my original agreement to pay. 

Provide verification and documentation about why this is a debt that I am required to pay. A copy of the last billing statement sent to me by the original creditor, state the amount of the debt when you obtained it and when that was. If you are contacting me outside of my state does your firm have a debt collection license from that place? If so, provide the date of the license, the name on the license, the license number, and the name address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license. 

I didn't receive those items and Penn Credit Corporation did receive the letter on XX/XX/2024 by XXXX XXXX certified mail so they can not say that they never received it. Penn Credit never responded to my letter until XX/XX/2024 that is the date that I received their response in the mail and the package has a postal stamp date of XX/XX/2024 and what I received was not everything that I requested. The only thing that I have received was the account number, name and address of said company. Penn Credit Corporation did not respond within 30 days, if they are telling me in my original letter for this said debt that I have 30 days to respond they are also required to do the same. 

I sent Penn Credit Corporation a response to their letter that I received on XX/XX/2024. My response letter is dated XX/XX/2024 stating that I still have not received everything that I requested from my original letter so I requested copies of any papers with my signature that show I agreed to pay Penn Credit Corporation for this said dept. Proof that you are licensed to collect debts in my state, full accounting by way of GAAP of both accounts receivable and payable. Proof that the statute of limitation has not expired. A statement that you will cease collection efforts until the requested information is provided. If you acquired this debt through assignment please provide documentation that confirms your authority to collect this debt on behalf of the original creditor. I also stated for Penn Credit Corporation to please provide this information within 30 days of receiving this request as required by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I you are unable to validate this debt, I expect you to cease collection efforts immediately and remove any negative reporting from my credit file. 

I still haven't received everything that I requested. Penn Credit Corporation received my letter dated XX/XX/2024 on XX/XX/2024 by way of XXXX XXXX XXXX certified mail so they can not say they didn't receive it. On XX/XX/2024 I received a request for payment letter from Penn Credit Corporation. How can they send me a request for payment letter when they never responded to my original letter within 30 days? Plus they never sent me everything that I requested. Penn Credit Corporation has wrongfully put a collections on my credit report as of XX/XX/2024. 

Penn Credit Corporation sold my information to the credit agencies without my consent so that sounds like identity theft to me. From Penn Credit Corporation actions they are basically telling me that don't care what they have violated and they don't care about what I have been requesting, they will never send me everything that I have requested because they can't so they are just going to do what they want to do, even though they don't have an agreement with my signature saying that I will pay them and they still want me to pay them without Penn Credit Corporation doing what is required.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Penn Credit Corporation,MI,48088,None,Consent provided,Web,11/5/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10691340

I saved a PDF copy of the website and offer terms to serve as a record of the original terms. 

After I completed the required activities I contacted M & T Bank 's Customer service to have them confirm that I had performed all required activities to avoid any misunderstandings before it was too late. 

At this time I was informed that the I was no longer eligible for the bonus due to not living in a specific geographic area and/or not having a copy of a mailed offer letter to my residence. 

I sent the M & T team copies of terms that I signed up for that did not include the geographic restrictions they claimed nor any indication that the offer was limited only to individuals that had received a mailed offer solicitation. I included ALL of the fine print for them to review yet they refused to acknowledge their error. 

M & T Bank will not honor the original terms I I signed up under to receive the {$500.00} bonus. They added a zip code qualification checker AFTER I opened my account.

I advised BMO my phone was stolen at the time of the transaction. I advised that the only transactions I was reported is to a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Transfers ) Which I did not authorize. However, They continued the interrogation on the phone telling me that XXXX XXXX XXXX  was used to fund the account and why was this used for funding. Again this has nothing to do with my claim.

Lastly, BMO brushed these transctions under the rug and refuse to provide a refund for these transactions I did not conduct, I do not know this person, I do not know whom this person is.

He connected me to someone seemed like from Citicards ( # shown as Citi XXXX @ XXXX ), the lady asked me to confirm my personal infor in order to mail my new credit card. I now don't remember what infor she asked me to confirm. 

When done w/her phone call, he called me back @ XXXX XXXX, said his name is XXXX XXXX and he's assigned to my case, and that when I receive new card I should call his direct number XXXX, he will remove all the fraud charges and get credit back to my acct.

After staying on the phone with XXXX XXXX for about XXXX min, that was almost XXXX XXXX  XXXX, I asked him why it took so long. His answer was because he worked from home and didn't have the regular gadgets as in the office and that's the reasons it took long and that he had to fill out application.

I went right back to the store, they couldnt duplicate the problem so they said it must be my cord. I bought a new cord. Periodically I had that issue. Ive had nothing but problems with this phone.

This was a bad phone from day 1 and if they would have exchanged it when I took it back an hour after I bought it I would have a reliable phone. So, I thought Ill stick it out until I can replace it when my upgrade period is in effect. WRONG. The representative that did my contract did not do what I asked for and did not give me the upgrade option for the first time since Ive had AT & T cell service.

Ive lived in XXXX for more than 42 years and never moved out of XXXX and never experienced hurricane. 

XXXX VACATION SCAM DISPUTE 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I searched for 1st time XXXX vacation with XXXX. Its website does not mention anything about XXXX is a hurricane season. So I booked a vacation for two to XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX for {$2700.00}. 

2 ) On XX/XX/XXXX : I tried to call XXXX Vacations to cancel my vacation due to severe hurricane season ( hurricane Helene hit XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and caused heavy damage in XXXX ). No live agent. I talked to robot and got disconnected twice. 

3 ) Then I had to use chat. Only chat robot was online. I got disconnected twice.

4 ) Chat referred me back to online cancellation. No live agent to help me.

5 ) I had to cancel online. Their system was designed to take money only, no other reason for cancellation is considered. After I clicked cancel my vacation theyre not going to refund my money. 

6 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX : I called Citi XXXX to report that scam and open dispute the whole amount of {$2700.00}. 

7 ) Then from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX hurricane Milton hit XXXX and caused heavy damage. 

8 ) On XX/XX/XXXX : I called Citi XXXX to follow up with my dispute. Citis rep told me a letter was sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX and asked me to wait. 

9 ) On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM : I called Citi XXXX 2nd time to follow up on existing dispute of {$2700.00} with XXXX Vacations scam. 

10 ) Citis rep again told me that a letter was sent out on XX/XX/XXXX, but I have not received it as of XX/XX/XXXX. Also I signed up for online communication but why the letter sent XX/XX/XXXX was not online. I asked Citis rep to email me that letter ; he said it would take 48 hrs. to process my request. It seems that Citi XXXX did not want to help me at all and wanted to force me to pay for that scam. 

11 ) On XX/XX/XXXX : After 3 days and I have not received any email from Citi XXXX. So I called Citi XXXX again at XXXXXXXX XXXX. The rep promised to send postal mail and email again. Call ended at XXXX XXXX 

This is a SCAM because if the website warned that XXXX is hurricane season, I would not have booked vacation in XXXX. Basically, anyone booked would have lost money 100 % because who would want to risk their lives going to XXXX during hurricane season. 

Lets say XXXX people booked XXXX vacation package with XXXX in XXXX, each cost averagely {$3000.00} ; 50 % bought vacation insurance ( {$300.00} x XXXX = {$450000.00} ) ; 50 % did not ( {$3000.00} x XXXX = {>= $1,000,000} ) So, when hurricane ( s ) hit that area, how many people do you think would be so stupid to still go into the Center of hurricane ( s ) for vacation? I think NONE. 

Then, XXXX would get a total FREE money of {>= $1,000,000} ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX dollars ) from cancelled vacations. 

How would you say its not a BIG SCAM??? 

So I would like to report this SCAM ( from XXXX ) and BAD BUSINESS practice ( from Citi XXXX citi.com ) to your agency for help resolving the matter. Also to prevent this from happening to others, I think the Government should do something about it.

I called Citibank and they said the dispute was reversed and closed saying the charges were valid. I told them I already paid XXXX off and they need to refund that money to my account. They said I can only appeal the decision which will take 90 days. I called XXXX and they claim there is no overpayment and it could take 45 days for them to receive the overpayments. In the meanwhile Im out {$1600.00}. I have accrued late charges from my auto payments on other bills due to having insufficient funds. Citibank told me they wouldnt reverse the original charges and they did and because of that I had to pay more interest and now another overpayment that no one seems to want to claim they have.

11/11/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I have a Barclays JetBlue MasterCard the number is XXXX and the last four digits are XXXX. I do not want to provide my credit card number blindly. 

The interest rate is too high on this card at approximately 30 % which I believe is a usury rate. I have asked repeatedly for them to lower the rate, yet they refuse. I pay this card every month. I have now done 2 balance transfers to two separate cards of 0 % promotional just to take the weight off of this card because they are charging me a minimum of {$410.00} in interest per month. I never use this card, yet the balance keeps increasing due to the extremely high interest rate on this c, ard. I should have paid this card down by half so far, yet because of the high interest payments, I have not made much of a dent in the principal at all. I now suspect fraudulent activity on this card that could very well be brought on by Barclays Bank rather than having somebody else using it. 

I would like the interest rate to be below 10 % and I need your assistance in doing this, that way I can pay off the balance and close the account. 

I originally signed up for this card because I was promised XXXX mileage points by JetBlue for opening it and using it. Then was prmised XXXX points for every dollar spent. I also font understand how my balance increased so much because my spending habits ate not out of cpntrol so I suspect fraud. 

I also never received the promotional XXXX mileage pointd for using this card, but never received the promotional XXXX points. At this point, I do have XXXX mileage points but, I was told by customer service at the interest payments that I'm paying do not translate into any mileage points, so I'm just paying interest only for basically nothing in return, for maintaining a balance on a card that I have stopped using. 

There is no value added and just giving my money away to the bank since I have a lot of other personal things that I'm trying to save up for but I can not due to this card. 

The interest is providing no value whatsoever I would appreciate your assistance in this matter and looking into Barclays practices in this country in their credit card Market as well as JetBlue for promoting it and not following up on their promise of bonus mileage points I think this is a crime and it turns into fraud and usury.

I explained to him that he needed to keep track of his balance better so as to avoid such fees in the future. Although he kept track of his actual purchases, existing debits that were set up via XXXX, as well as attempts to pay and be paid by his friends through XXXX, resulted in multiple additional {$35.00} fees for both overdraft charges and, when the balance became less than XXXX, insufficient funds fees ( also {$35.00} ) - the latter even though the bank did not actually pay the amounts on his behalf. Ultimately, there were more than {$350.00} in bank fees charged for less than {$50.00} of claimed and attempted purchases. 

I called the bank to ask them to stop all activity on the account in order to stop the accumulation of additional fees. They advised that they couldn't do that - I needed to go to the branch in person to close the account. After taking off work for an afternoon to visit the branch, they advised me that I first needed to pay the accumulated fees before they would agree to close the account. In other words, they refused to close the account and prevent the assessment of additional fees, which continued to accumulate for several weeks after I tried to close the account.

The sticker price was {$62000.00}. Within XXXX weeks, I started experiencing issues with the car. While driving the car, it completely shut off. I was forced to turn down a street and use my emergency brake as the brakes did not work. When I brought it to the dealership, I was told that nothing was wrong with the car. In XXXX, I got a letter in the mail stating that there was a recall for an electrical issue. The dealership denied any wrongdoing As the weather turned colder ( Fall/Winter XXXX ) the electric mode started to fail so it was only allowing gas use. After many more back-and-forth trips to the dealership, I was eventually told that the electric mode simply does not work when it is cold out. I tried to go through XXXX XXXX who offered trade assistance to get out of the car. I was then told that there was over $ XXXX in negative equity just after 6 months of owning the car. Needless to say, I did not go that route. 

The car worked ok during the summer but around XX/XX/XXXX the car 's electric mode failed again. To make things worse, the car felt like it was "" bucking '' and not running correctly. Again, after much back and forth from the dealership, I was told that nothing could be done unless a check engine light came on. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, the check engine light did come on and through diagnostics, I was told that it was going to cost {$25000.00} to fix the vehicle. Although this is covered under warranty, I continue to have concerns over the safety of the vehicle, given the history of issues experienced. I once again requested that I be let out of my lease but they forced me to take the car back. After driving it off the lot, I noticed that the electric mode still did not work but I was told that the $ XXXX repairs did not address that issue. I attached the response from the dealership. 

I tried once again over the winter ( XXXX ) to get the car returned but the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX denied my request. 

This summer, the car had various problems such as shaking while going over bumps and the touch screen freezing. I was told that it needed more repairs but they can not provide a loaner. I am still trying to figure out a way to drop it off and still have transportation. 

This XXXX, I received a letter in the mail informing me of a new recall. This time it stated that the car was a potential fire hazard. I have attached the letter to the email. There is currently no fix for this recall and per the letter, I am not to park it near any buildings or other vehicles. I am still expected to make my lease payment.

My original creditor has charged and written off this debt. No where in my original contract did I read that this debt can be sued for, in fact I never went through mediation with the original creditor nor was it offered by velocity investments LLC. I requested on plea paperwork a motion for discovery the following items within 30 days : 1. Master purchase agreement - showing contract governing the assignment or sale of the alleged debt. This is warranted to confirm the right to sue as I never was given an opportunity to go through mediation or was offered.

2. Signed contracts - all signed contracts or agreements between myself and the original creditor or between myself and their agency.

3. Affidavit of responsibility - signed affidavit sworn under penalty of perjury by the individual who is personally responsible for the daily accounting and maintenance of this particular account,
attesting to the accuracy and completeness of the account records.

4. Original Credit Agreement - original credit agreement or any document evidencing the credit relationship between myself and the original creditor.

5. Validation of debt - validation of debt including any calculations correspondence or proof of debt amount.

6. Documents evidencing charge-off or written off debt by original creditor, including relevant account statements.

7. All documents showing assignment or transfer of debt from the original creditor to the plaintiff.

8. Communication records- showing communication between myself and upstart and myself and velocity investments LLC including any including letters, emails, phone call logs.

9. Internal notes - internal notes, memos, or records maintained by your agency relating to this accounts history.

1. Identify the date in which the plaintiff acquired the debt in question and the source from which it was acquired.

2. Provide a full chain of title for the debt from the original creditor to the plaintiff.

3. State whether the plaintiff has any records showing the debt was ever charged off or written off by the original creditor.

Additionally, all documents were requested in good faith and I have yet to receive a response from Velocity Investment, LLC and will now have to go to court soon. I asked for these documents because I understand the laws that protect me especially the The FDCPA is the fair debt collection practices act, which is a federal law generally requires debt collectors to provide clear and accurate information about the debt, which could be interpreted to necessitate details beyond a simple Bill of sale and effectively requires aspects of the purchase agreement to demonstrate the debts origin & ownership of transfer.

Without all of the requested information what velocity investments LLC is doing can be seen as a direct violation of my rights under the FDCPA. If the said purchase agreement can not be provided, after it is mentioned in the bill of sale I can only assume Velocity Investments LLC is intentionally not providing the requested document as they have no true legal right to sue or collect.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Velocity Portfolio Group,SC,29016,None,Consent provided,Web,11/14/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10803410

Despite having my phone number on file with Citi Bank, I have repeatedly been unable to regain access to my account via phone. This has caused significant inconvenience and concern as I am unable to manage my funds or conduct essential banking transactions. 

Timeline of Events Initial Access Issue On [ insert date of first incident ], I attempted to access my Citi Bank account by phone, using the phone number on file. However, I was unable to complete the authentication process due to [ specify reason, e.g., Citi Banks system not recognizing my phone number, failure in automated verification, or lack of access to necessary authentication steps ].

2. Attempts to Resolve the Issue [ First Call Date ] : I contacted Citi Bank customer service, explaining the access issue and confirming that my phone number on file was accurate. During this call, the representative [ describe response, e.g., reaffirmed that my number was on file but could not explain why I was unable to use it for account recovery ]. 
[ Follow-Up Date ] : After my first attempt failed, I called Citi Bank again , requesting further assistance. I was advised to try alternative methods of access, such as using the online portal. However, due to [ reason if applicable, e.g., two-factor authentication requirement tied to the phone on file ], I was still unable to regain access.

3. Continued Access Problems and Escalation Attempts Over the next few weeks, I continued to make calls to Citi Bank customer service, each time encountering the same issue. Citi Bank representatives confirmed that my phone number was on file but could not address the technical barrier preventing me from authenticating through the phone system.

4. Escalation and Request for Resolution [ Date of Escalation Attempt ] : Frustrated by the repeated failures to regain access, I requested that the issue be escalated to a supervisor or technical support. During this escalation attempt, I requested [ any specific action, such as a reset of authentication methods or an alternative verification process ]. 
Outcome : Despite my escalation request, I received no clear resolution. Citi Bank representatives provided no solution or workaround that would allow me to access my account via phone as I should be able to with the phone number on file.

5. Financial and Personal Implications Since I was unable to access my account, I faced significant inconvenience and potential financial impacts, including : [ List any delayed payments, overdraft fees, or other financial impacts if applicable ] [ Mention any inability to access necessary funds or make essential transactions ] 6. Additional Actions Taken In a final attempt to regain access, I submitted a formal complaint with Citi Bank on [ complaint submission date ].

Resolution Sought I am seeking assistance from the CFPB in
order to : 1. Prompt Citi Bank to resolve the technical or verification issues preventing phone access with my number on file.

2. Ensure that Citi Bank offers a reliable authentication method for customers experiencing similar issues, so they can regain access to their accounts efficiently. 
XXXX. Request compensation for any financial impact, inconvenience, or delay in transactions caused by the ongoing access issue. 

Conclusion This issue has been ongoing since [ initial issue date ], and despite multiple attempts to work with Citi Bank for a solution, I have not been able to regain access to my account through the standard authentication process with the phone number on file.

Validation of the Debt : Please provide detailed documentation verifying the validity of the alleged debt, including the original creditor 's name, the account number, the date of the last payment, the original balance, and a complete payment history. I also request copies of any agreements or contracts pertaining to the alleged debt. 2. Cease and Desist Communication : Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1692c, I am requesting that you cease all communication with me in relation to this debt, except as specifically allowed under the FDCPA. This includes communication through telephone calls, letters, emails, or any other medium. According to 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( 2 ), communication includes the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium, including the reporting of information to a credit reporting agency. Therefore, I specifically request that you cease all communication through the medium of my credit report. 3. Licensing Information : I request that you provide documentation establishing that your agency is licensed to collect debt in my state. Please include a copy of your current license or registration, as required by applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, I request information regarding your agency 's license to collect debt in your state. Please provide documentation demonstrating that your agency is duly licensed to operate as a debt collector in your state. 4. Errors and Omissions Insurance : As a professional debt collection agency, I request that you provide your agency 's errors and omissions insurance information. Please provide the name of your insurance provider, the policy number, and any other relevant details. 5. Bill of Assignment : I request that you provide a complete and valid bill of assignment or sale, demonstrating that the alleged debt was legally assigned or transferred to your agency.

Please note that failure to provide the requested information within [ 30 days or a reasonable time frame according to local laws ] from the date of receipt of this letter will result in the presumption that the debt is invalid and unenforceable. Furthermore, any continued attempts to collect this debt without providing the requested validation will be considered a violation of the FDCPA. I request that all future communication regarding this debt be conducted in writing and sent to the address provided above. This is to ensure accurate record-keeping and to protect my rights under the FDCPA. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I expect your cooperation in providing the requested documentation within the designated time frame.

11/10/2024,Debt collection,Telecommunications debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"I am filing this formal complaint against EASTERN account system inc, with the CFPB due to their attempts to collect a debt whose validity has not been verified, despite my repeated requests for documentation and verification in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). The FDCPA grants consumers the right to request validation and verification of any claimed debt and requires the creditor to provide adequate documentation proving the legitimacy of said debt.

In response to the collection notice received on XX/XX/year>, I formally contacted Eastern to request full validation of this debt under the FDCPA. In my letter, tracked with reference number XXXX, I detailed the required documentation, including a copy of the original agreement, the name and address of the current creditor, a breakdown of charges and interest, and confirmation that the debt falls within the statute of limitations. However, to date, Eastern has responded only with a copy of a bill in my name, which does not meet the legal standards for debt validation. This incomplete response does not allow me to assess the validity of the debt nor confirm that the amount claimed is accurate and attributable to me.

Requests for Intervention : Immediate Block on Credit Bureau Reporting : Since Eastern has failed to fulfill its obligation to provide complete debt validation as required by the FDCPA, I request that the CFPB intervene to block any attempt by Eastern to report this debt to credit bureaus. Until Eastern meets the validation requirements set forth by the FDCPA, they should not be permitted to take any action that could impact my credit history.

Suspension of All Collection Actions Until Debt Validation : Under the FDCPA, Eastern is required to cease all collection actions until the debt is properly validated. I ask that the CFPB take steps to ensure that Eastern halts all collection efforts and any further contact with me or third parties until complete documentation is provided.

Strict Compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : The FCRA mandates that any information reported to credit bureaus be accurate and verifiable. Since Eastern has not provided the requested debt verification, this debt does not meet the FCRAs requirements for accuracy and verifiability. I therefore request that the CFPB take action to prevent Eastern from reporting this debt until its legitimacy is fully established.

Application of Sanctions as Provided by Law : Due to Easterns failure to provide the necessary information within the legally required timeframe and in accordance with FDCPA requirements, I ask that the CFPB consider all available sanctions and corrective measures to ensure that Eastern meets its obligations for transparency and accuracy in debt management.

11/9/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Fees charged,"This is my Second Complaint against Wells Fargo Mortgage Department : Background : My home insurance Break ( XXXX ). 
My home insurance was with XXXX ( Auto renewal policy ). However, XXXX has not renewed my home insurance because it wanted me to add auto insurance with home insurance for renewal ( an absurd policy of XXXX ). Since I was away from home, I haven't received prior notifications from XXXX, so I could not organise insurance elsewhere and the home insurance eventually got lapsed. 
Wells Fargo notified the lapse to me lately on XX/XX/XXXX via email ( 24 days later ), so I immediately started taking quotes and organised the insurance. It took a couple more days, as the insurance company required a drive- by inspection prior to confirmation of the policy and eventually it all set up from XX/XX/XXXX. I sent the policy pages to Wells Fargo immediately, so also the insurer. 
However, Wells Fargo insisted me to get coverage for the lapsed period. I have contacted the previous insurer, but they refused to do so. I was helpless to get coverage for lapsed period elsewhere and I notified it to the mortgage company. However, it enforced XXXX XXXX  for the lapsed period and charged me {$310.00}. I dont see any logic for such an action. 
I have also asked Wells Fargo to provide me the policy page and insurance details, but they have not provided my any such documents or receipt. 
I suspect Wells Fargo has a great deal of associate business with other insurance companies whether it is for home insurance/PMI insurance and charge the customers unlawfully. I request your intervention and check if the Banks policy is in violation of the State and Federal Laws. 




Email sent to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/year> : Hi With reference to your letter dated XX/XX/year>. 
I have contacted the previous insurer ( XXXX ) to get coverage for the lapse period, but they are not willing to accept it, as they want a multi policy to get home coverage ( email copy attached ). This is a very ridiculous situation and a corrupt industry standard. I am so frustrated. 
Had you reminded me a bit earlier than XX/XX/XXXX ideally within a few days after the lapse, I could have secured the insurance in a timely manner. I didn't realise that it was lapsed until I got your email notification. 
If you want to penalise me for the lapse, please feel free to do so.

Ive already told them I will pay the rest of the debt, but they are trying to get me to pay an amount of debt that I already paid. 
They are trying to threaten me to double pay, and they have already threatened to seize property that I dont even have in my name. 
They already took me thru a Civil summons which I responded to and I keep responding to them. I have agreed to make payment amount, I could even understand if they needed to add a smaller amount of {$500.00} or less to the balance, but that is not enough for them. They are misrepresenting what is still owed, I have documented proof that I only owe so much left. 
I also found online in regards to LoanMe : LoanMe personal loans may have a low barrier to entry as well as a simple application process and fast funding, but the risks involved are high. The triple-digit interest rates are borderline predatory and can create a serious financial drain.

Although, {$1400.00} was paid from XX/XX/year> to XX/XX/year> with only {$220.00} going to the principalthere is documented proof as part of the civil summons.

This is to say having a routing number and account number to a bank account I have never establish arriving in the mail is a serious concern. Especially since I have no way to contact this company. All the paper has besides the po box address is a QR code to "" Scan to Verify Your Identity '' This is to say, I am sure if I try to contact them other than by snail mail, they will have to 'verify my identiy ' to talk to anyone, and thereby inadvertently trick individuals to confirming I am a willing partner in their scam to establish a unsolicited account and credit card.

11/18/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Subject : Escalated Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Reporting of Cancelled Debt by MACYS/CBNA To Whom It May Concern, I am filing this escalated complaint regarding the continued reporting of a cancelled debt by MACYS/CBNA ( Account ending in XXXX ) on my credit report with XXXX and XXXX, despite the issuance of a Form 1099-C documenting the cancellation of this debt. 

Key Issues and Violations 1. Continued Reporting of Cancelled Debt : MACYS/CBNA issued a Form 1099-C for {$3100.00}, indicating that the debt was cancelled as of XX/XX/year>. 
The continued reporting of this debt as charged off on my credit report contradicts the identifiable event of cancellation as documented in the 1099-C. This inconsistency violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which mandates maximum possible accuracy in credit reporting.

2. Failure to Update Credit Reporting : Despite the identifiable event of cancellation, XXXX and XXXX continue to list this account as charged off, with no indication of the debt being cancelled. 
Reporting a debt as both charged off and cancelled is misleading and harmful to my creditworthiness.

3. Misrepresentation of Debt Status : The issuance of a 1099-C signifies that the creditor has discharged the debt, which should result in its removal or accurate update on credit reports. Failure to do so misrepresents the legal status of the debt, potentially violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692e ). 
4. Harm to Creditworthiness : This inaccurate reporting significantly impacts my credit score and financial opportunities. The continued derogatory reporting is unjustified given the cancellation of the debt. 

Requested Resolution To resolve this matter, I respectfully request that the CFPB : 1. Investigate MACYS/CBNAs compliance with FCRA and FDCPA regulations regarding the reporting of this account.

2. Require MACYS/CBNA to instruct XXXX and XXXX to remove the derogatory information related to this account from my credit report.

3. Provide written confirmation that the inaccurate information has been corrected or removed from my credit report.

Supporting Documentation To support this complaint, I have attached : A copy of the Form 1099-C issued by MACYS/CBNA for this account. 
My credit report highlighting the continued reporting of this account as charged off. 

Contact Information Full Name : XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, TN XXXX Phone Number : XXXX Email Address : XXXX I request that this matter be addressed promptly and that a resolution is provided within the mandated timeframe for investigations.

They say the only way to possibly pay more principal is to make two payments on the same day but this doesnt guarantee an all principal payment. They state interest accrued daily being the reason for this. In addition the terms of my loan are 20 year installment loan with set monthly payment of {$1000.00}. For the last few months I have paid early from due date and even doing so they are applying my set payment amount 100 % to Interest and only if I pay more is some of that applied to principal. They will not provide me an amortization schedule and given this is a closed end Installment loan I am unsure how I Would ever pay down this loan if the continue to not apply my payments to any principal. The rep informed me they are in Utah as if that gives them the right to use these unfair deceptive, bait and switch rent a bank scams on unsuspecting consumers. They are giving me no other options here than to file this complaint and informed me they have no complaint process and they would not have anyone else contact me. They also told me they act independently from Regions so there is nothing the parent company can do for me. They were not able to tell me who regulates them or who I could contact other than FDIC which is odd to me and FDIC is not who I should contact for there violations of the TILA and UDAAP.

All I want to be able to do is pay my loan on time and have The appropriate amounts be applied to both principal and interest and to be given a way to pay down sooner.

Unfortunately, I find this case should be re-opened. I received the company 's response ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and confirmed that they issued the correct amount of mileage in the statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ). For many years, the mileage included in the statement was transferred to the XXXX program within 1-2 business days. However, this time, it has not been done until today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Because this was out of the usual processing period, I called US Bank and talked to the rep. The rep also stated that it should have been transferred to the XXXX account last week and put me on hold to speak to the supervisor. After 15 minutes on hold, listening to the background music, the rep returned and said that her supervisor needed more time with the research and asked for another holding. I waited for another 10-15 minutes. Then, suddenly, the background music changed. I thought it was strange, but I kept waiting. Finally, someone came back. But, she was not the same rep, but another rep. This new rep asked me why I called. What?!?!??! So, while on hold, my call was transferred to another person in another department. This new person had no idea why I was waiting on the phone and asked me my previous concern. I did not think it was fair to repeat the whole thing again after spending 30 minutes, so I told her that I would continue this with CFPB.

I've had previous experiences with some reps saying I would be transferred to someone else in another department or I would get a return call later time. But, something I had today was a new experience. They should have been honest if they couldn't find the solution and get my phone number or email information so they could contact me later instead of transferring a customer without notification. 

Basically, this issue still needs to be resolved. The bank pretended to fulfill its responsibility of issuing the promised mileage. However, it failed to transfer the mileage to the linked mileage program properly. Furthermore, it shook off the customer who inquired about this matter by silently transferring the call to another random rep to repeat the never-ending cycle.

11/7/2024,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"Page XXXX of XXXX XX/XX/year> US Bank is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may be being perpetuated. If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam with the customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is : particularly vulnerable, or if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected. There are some recommendations to organizations for protecting customers from financial harm that might occur as a result of fraud or financial abuse ; and gives guidance on how to recognize customers who might be at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary actions to prevent or minimize financial harm. These recommendations are established as a general principle, the organization should deliver a service that : XXXX ) Takes a proactive approach to minimizing risks, impact and incidences of financial harm and it sets out systems and tools for the prevention and detection of fraud and financial abuse. As a general point, it says organizations should ensure that all systems are developed using technologies and methodologies that are effective in the prevention of fraud and financial abuse, through authorized and unauthorized payments, thereby minimizing the risk of financial harm to customers. As regards to the detection of fraud and financial abuse, it says the organization : A ) should have measures in place across all payment channels and products to detect suspicious transactions or activities that might indicate fraud or financial abuse. It then lists the following examples of suspicious activity on customer accounts : a. multiple cheque books; b. sudden increased spending ; XXXX transfers to other accounts ; d. multiple password attempts ; e. logins from new devices, multiple geographical locations ; f. sudden changes to the operation of the account ; Unusual transactions are transactions whose amount, characteristics and frequency bear no relation to the economic activity of the customer, exceed normal market parameters or have no apparent legal justification. g. a withdrawal or payment for a large amount ; h. a payment or series of payments to a new payee ; i. financial activity that matches a known method of fraud or financial abuse. 
Page XXXX of XXXX XX/XX/year> B ) organizations should have a process in place to ensure that staff make contact with the customer to verify the financial activity, challenge its authenticity, explain the nature of the suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of action. US Bank are yet to show, or otherwise provide me with, a compelling argument that their wide-ranging experience and wealth of specialist knowledge in detecting transactional anomalies were not sufficient to avert the fraud at issue. By contrast, I have provided a multitude of sound and powerful reasons by which requiring their involvement has not only been pressingly relevant but also eminently reasonable and well-justified. Rather than empathizing with and undertaking substantial efforts to convey their knowledge of the existence of such regulations abroad and thereafter use it to protect and proactively relieve the plight of consumers who have been cheated out of their money and whose role in society is properly fulfilled, positively contributing to local economic growth, development and sustainability US Bank adopts a rather insouciant attitude toward my financial predicament portrayed herein. I am deeply convinced that the disastrous results that I have previously elaborated upon will continue to ensue if no responsibility is adopted by US Bank in relation to this matter. I have also thoroughly detailed why they can not simply dismiss this problem by strictly adhering to legal technicalities which, after careful reflection, struck me as being nothing more than self-interest. Indeed, it seems to me utterly unfair to disregard fragile, sensitive, and vulnerable consumers who are afflicted by such allegedly malevolent acts, thereby keeping an unjust status-quo that is corrupting our society at its core. Conclusion : Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management system, demonstrating their undisputed ability to responsibly and pre-emptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly adopted technologies aimed at effectively navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavors undertaken in this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent practices. Astonishingly, I am pondering how it is that, despite being shown that US Banks business conduct was insufficient insofar as background checks are concerned, they keep refuting their indisputable role and responsibility in connection with the matter herein discussed. The points that I have hitherto made are too crucial to be taken lightly. US Banks non-observance of the fundamental principles of justice that is, to completely overlook and not even remotely try to mitigate the suffering of vulnerable consumers is inexcusable given the size of the establishment and the vast resources at its disposal as the direct result of the patronage of clients like myself. If it was, indeed, solely my responsibility, we must then believe at least one of the following clauses : a ) financial institutions have absolutely no role whatsoever in preventing and detecting fraud, b ) the fraud in question was not reasonably foreseeable, or c ) the transactions in question Page 6 of XXXX XX/XX/year> were not sufficiently alarming. It is extremely unfortunate that US Bank pushes quite hard for me to believe all three of these thingsdespite evidence to the contrary. In summary, I respectively ask your organization to consider my points, given your personal and companywide obligation to provide a fair and reasonable investigation into the complaint. I look forward to your input and would gladly cooperate to reach a fair and reasonable outcome. Thank you.

Additionally, I am officially opting out of any and all authorizations I may have previously grantedwhether written, unwritten, verbal, or non-verbalregarding the reporting of information that does not comply with federal law.

Legal Basis for Removal Pursuant to 16 CFR Part 313 ( Privacy of Consumer Financial Information ) and 16 CFR Part 433 ( Preservation of Consumers ' Claims and Defenses ), I am asserting the following : 16 CFR Part 313 mandates the protection of consumer financial information and restricts the unauthorized sharing of personal data.

16 CFR Part 433 ensures that consumers ' claims and defenses are preserved, prohibiting the inclusion of unfair or deceptive acts or practices by data furnishers in credit reporting. Specifically, 16 CFR 433.2 ( a ) requires any holder of a consumer credit contract to be subject to all claims and defenses the debtor could assert against the original seller.

Unauthorized Reporting of Charge-Off Accounts Under FCRA regulations, a charge-off should not appear on my credit report as it represents a certificate of indebtedness or an accounting adjustment, which in legal terms can be categorized as income and therefore should not be reported to credit bureaus. The report of this charge-off represents an inaccurate portrayal of my financial standing and an unauthorized disclosure of my private information.

Request for Deletion and Compensation I hereby demand the following : Immediate Deletion of any charge-offs or similarly misclassified accounts that violate 16 CFR Parts 313 and 433, FCRA, and the Truth in Lending Act.

Compensation for the violation of my rights as a consumer due to the unauthorized reporting of inaccurate information. The impact of this erroneous reporting has affected my creditworthiness and caused me undue stress and inconvenience.

Confirmation in writing that all inaccurate and unauthorized information has been removed from my credit file and details regarding the compensation process.

Notice of Preservation of Consumer Claims and Defenses As per 16 CFR 433.2, please note the following provision applies : NOTICEANY HOLDER OF THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED PURSUANT HERETO OR WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF. RECOVERY HEREUNDER BY THE DEBTOR SHALL NOT EXCEED AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DEBTOR HEREUNDER.

Failure to respond to this request may lead to further action to enforce my rights as a consumer, including but not limited to legal avenues.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I expect confirmation of these changes and a response regarding compensation within 30 days, as per the FCRA 's required response timeline.

( Pub. XXXX XXXX, title XXXX, XXXX, as added Pub. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX. ) XXXX General disclosure requirements. 
( a ) Form of disclosures ( 1 ) General.

( i ) The creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously.

( ii ) The creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart in writing, in a form that the consumer may keep, except that : ( A ) The following disclosures need not be written : Disclosures under 1026.6 ( b ) ( 3 ) of charges that are imposed as part of an open-end ( not home-secured ) plan that are not required to be disclosed under 1026.6 ( b ) ( 2 ) and related disclosures of charges under 1026.9 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( iii ) ( B ) ; disclosures under 1026.9 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( vi ) ; disclosures under 1026.9 ( d ) when a finance charge is imposed at the time of the transaction ; and disclosures under 1026.56 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( i ). 

( B ) The following disclosures need not be in a retainable form : Disclosures that need not be written under paragraph ( a ) ( XXXX ) ( ii ) ( A ) of this section ; disclosures for credit and charge card applications and solicitations under 1026.60 ; home-equity disclosures under 1026.40 ( d ) ; the alternative summary billing-rights statement under 1026.9 ( a ) ( 2 ) ; the credit and charge card renewal disclosures required under 1026.9 ( e ) ; and the payment requirements under 1026.10 ( b ), except as provided in 1026.7 ( b ) ( 13 ).

( iii ) The disclosures required by this subpart may be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ( E-Sign Act ) ( 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq. ). The disclosures required by 1026.60, 1026.40, and 1026.16 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act in the circumstances set forth in those sections.

( 2 ) Terminology.

( i ) Terminology used in providing the disclosures required by this subpart shall be consistent.

( ii ) For home-equity plans subject to 1026.40, the terms finance charge and annual percentage rate, when required to be disclosed with a corresponding amount or percentage rate, shall be more conspicuous than any other required disclosure. The terms need not be more conspicuous when used for periodic statement disclosures under 1026.7 ( a ) ( 4 ) and for advertisements under 1026.16.

( iii ) If disclosures are required to be presented in a tabular format pursuant to paragraph ( a ) ( 3 ) of this section, the term penalty APR shall be used, as applicable. The term penalty APR need not be used in reference to the annual percentage rate that applies with the loss of a promotional rate, assuming the annual percentage rate that applies is not greater than the annual percentage rate that would have applied at the end of the promotional period ; or if the annual percentage rate that applies with the loss of a promotional rate is a variable rate, the annual percentage rate is calculated using the same index and margin as would have been used to calculate the annual percentage rate that would have applied at the end of the promotional period. If credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required as part of the plan, the term required shall be used and the program shall be identified by its name. If an annual percentage rate is required to be presented in a tabular format pursuant to paragraph ( a ) ( 3 ) ( i ) or ( a ) ( 3 ) ( iii ) of this section, the term fixed, or a similar term, may not be used to describe such rate unless the creditor also specifies a time period that the rate will be fixed and the rate will not increase during that period, or if no such time period is provided, the rate will not increase while the plan is open.

( 3 ) Specific formats.

( i ) Certain disclosures for credit and charge card applications and solicitations must be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of 1026.60 ( a ) ( 2 ).

( ii ) Certain disclosures for home-equity plans must precede other disclosures and must be given in accordance with the requirements of 1026.40 ( a ).

( iii ) Certain account-opening disclosures must be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of 1026.6 ( b ) ( 1 ).

( iv ) Certain disclosures provided on periodic statements must be grouped together in accordance with the requirements of 1026.7 ( b ) ( 6 ) and ( b ) ( 13 ).

( v ) Certain disclosures provided on periodic statements must be given in accordance with the requirements of 1026.7 ( b ) ( 12 ).

( vi ) Certain disclosures accompanying checks that access a credit card account must be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of 1026.9 ( b ) ( 3 ).

( vii ) Certain disclosures provided in a change-in-terms notice must be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of 1026.9 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( iv ) ( D ).

( viii ) Certain disclosures provided when a rate is increased due to delinquency, default or as a penalty must be provided in a tabular format in accordance with the requirements of 1026.9 ( g ) ( 3 ) ( ii ).

( b ) Time of disclosures ( 1 ) Account-opening disclosures ( i ) General rule. The creditor shall furnish account-opening disclosures required by 1026.6 before the first transaction is made under the plan.

( ii ) Charges imposed as part of an open-end ( not home-secured ) plan. Charges that are imposed as part of an open-end ( not home-secured ) plan and are not required to be disclosed under 1026.6 ( b ) ( 2 ) may be disclosed after account opening but before the consumer agrees to pay or becomes obligated to pay for the charge, provided they are disclosed at a time and in a manner that a consumer would be likely to notice them. This provision does not apply to charges imposed as part of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of 1026.40.

( iii ) Telephone purchases. Disclosures required by 1026.6 may be provided as soon as reasonably practicable after the first transaction if : ( A ) The first transaction occurs when a consumer contacts a merchant by telephone to purchase goods and at the same time the consumer accepts an offer to finance the purchase by establishing an open-end plan with the merchant or third-party creditor ; ( B ) The merchant or third-party creditor permits consumers to return any goods financed under the plan and provides consumers with a sufficient time to reject the plan and return the goods free of cost after the merchant or third-party creditor has provided the written disclosures required by 1026.6 ; and ( C ) The consumer 's right to reject the plan and return the goods is disclosed to the consumer as a part of the offer to finance the purchase.

( iv ) Membership fees ( A ) General. In general, a creditor may not collect any fee before account-opening disclosures are provided. A creditor may collect, or obtain the consumer 's agreement to pay, membership fees, including application fees excludable from the finance charge under 1026.4 ( c ) ( 1 ), before providing account-opening disclosures if, after receiving the disclosures, the consumer may reject the plan and have no obligation to pay these fees ( including application fees ) or any other fee or charge. A membership fee for purposes of this paragraph has the same meaning as a fee for the issuance or availability of credit described in 1026.60 ( b ) ( 2 ). If the consumer rejects the plan, the creditor must promptly refund the membership fee if it has been paid, or take other action necessary to ensure the consumer is not obligated to pay that fee or any other fee or charge.

( B ) Home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject to the requirements of 1026.40 are not subject to the requirements of paragraph ( b ) ( 1 ) ( iv ) ( A ) of this section.

( v ) Application fees. A creditor may collect an application fee excludable from the finance charge under 1026.4 ( c ) ( 1 ) before providing account-opening disclosures. However, if a consumer rejects the plan after receiving account-opening disclosures, the consumer must have no obligation to pay such an application fee, or if the fee was paid, it must be refunded. See 1026.5 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( iv ) ( A ).

( 2 ) Periodic statements ( i ) Statement required. The creditor shall mail or deliver a periodic statement as required by 1026.7 for each billing cycle at the end of which an account has a debit or credit balance of more than {$1.00} or on which a finance charge has been imposed. A periodic statement need not be sent for an account if the creditor deems it uncollectible, if delinquency collection proceedings have been instituted, if the creditor has charged off the account in accordance with loan-loss provisions and will not charge any additional fees or interest on the account, or if furnishing the statement would violate Federal law.

( ii ) Timing requirements ( A ) Credit card accounts under an open-end ( not home-secured ) consumer credit plan. For credit card accounts under an open-end ( not home-secured ) consumer credit plan, a card issuer must adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that : ( 1 ) Periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the statement pursuant to 1026.7 ( b ) ( 11 ) ( i ) ( A ) ; and ( 2 ) The card issuer does not treat as late for any purpose a required minimum periodic payment received by the card issuer within 21 days after mailing or delivery of the periodic statement disclosing the due date for that payment.

( B ) Open-end consumer credit plans. For accounts under an open-end consumer credit plan, a creditor must adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that : ( 1 ) If a grace period applies to the account : ( i ) Periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the date on which the grace period expires; and ( ii ) The creditor does not impose finance charges as a result of the loss of the grace period if a payment that satisfies the terms of the grace period is received by the creditor within 21 days after mailing or delivery of the periodic statement.

( 2 ) Regardless of whether a grace period applies to the account : ( i ) Periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 14 days prior to the date on which the required minimum periodic payment must be received in order to avoid being treated as late for any purpose; and ( ii ) The creditor does not treat as late for any purpose a required minimum periodic payment received by the creditor within 14 days after mailing or delivery of the periodic statement.

( 3 ) For purposes of paragraph ( b ) ( 2 ) ( ii ) ( B ) of this section, grace period means a period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate.

( 3 ) Credit and charge card application and solicitation disclosures. The card issuer shall furnish the disclosures for credit and charge card applications and solicitations in accordance with the timing requirements of 1026.60.

( 4 ) Home-equity plans. Disclosures for home-equity plans shall be made in accordance with the timing requirements of 1026.40 ( b ).

( c ) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates. Disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. If any information necessary for accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor, it shall make the disclosure based on the best information reasonably available and shall state clearly that the disclosure is an estimate.

( d ) Multiple creditors ; multiple consumers. If the credit plan involves more than one creditor, only one set of disclosures shall be given, and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor must comply with the requirements that this part imposes on any or all of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures may be made to any consumer who is primarily liable on the account. If the right of rescission under 1026.15 is applicable, however, the disclosures required by 1026.6 and 1026.15 ( b ) shall be made to each consumer having the right to rescind.

( e ) Effect of subsequent events. If a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of an event that occurs after the creditor mails or delivers the disclosures, the resulting inaccuracy is not a violation of this part, although new disclosures may be required under 1026.9 ( c ).

11/12/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Card opened without my consent or knowledge,"We've owned our timeshare for a year now, and over this period, its become clear to us that we were emotionally manipulated into acquiring it. XXXX clearly told the representative that while we might consider it in the future, our financial situation at the time made this an impractical decision. Despite us repeatedly stating we couldnt afford it, the representativesparticularly XXXX persistently urged with comments like, Dont you want to do this for your wife? This pressure was inappropriate, given our financial constraints and other urgent responsibilities. The encounter with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and a financial team member with a XXXX  accent left us feeling cornered and emotionally pressured. The initial approach at the shopping center, where they shared a personal story of tragedy, was laden with emotional manipulation. Looking back, we regret not walking away after the presentation, but their friendliness made it hard to say no. 

We were also coerced into signing up for a credit card as part of this process, adding further financial strain. The timeshare was originally pitched as a flexible plan where we could use our points at hotels worldwide, making spontaneous trips easier. We were promised an additional XXXX points on top of our initial XXXX, totaling XXXX for our first annual points, with the bonus supposedly valid until the end of our second year. These points were essential for us since we planned to use them for a long-delayed honeymoon. However, during a follow-up call with Wyndham, we learned that these extra points had already expired. Despite owning the timeshare for a year, we haven't had a chance to use it. This is due to our limited paid vacation timeonly one week per year, including sick daysmaking it difficult to use the points as intended, which XXXX tried explaining to the representative. 

This timeshare purchase has been a huge mistake, resulting in specific hardships and sacrifices. The decision has negatively impacted our credit scores and diverted funds we had allocated for other essential parts of our lives. We didnt realize that acquiring the timeshare would equate to taking on the burden of a new mortgage, a fact that came to light only when our mortgage team contacted XXXX after our home purchase in XX/XX/XXXX. Further financial strain arose when we needed car financing following XXXX accident in XX/XX/XXXX. The lack of transparency about the credit card, which was signed up through a third party without our knowledge, raises serious concerns about how our personal information was handled. The combined financial strain, unfulfilled promises, and inability to use the timeshare make this investment feel entirely unworthy. 

Our understanding of the timeshare 's functionality grew more confusing when we tried to use our points at a Wyndham hotel. Contrary to what we were led to believe, we could only use reward points earned from other stays, not the points we purchased. Learning about the narrow ten-day window for cancellation was yet another unexpected surprise. This timeshare has not only failed to meet our expectations but has also severely impacted our quality of life. The financial stress and burden it created have prevented us from fully settling into our home. The lack of enjoyment and fulfillment from this investment only reinforces our desire to terminate the agreement. 

Considering all these factors, we feel the only reasonable path forward is to seek the cancellation of our timeshare. We would greatly appreciate any guidance on the steps needed to relieve us of this financial and emotional burden. The misinformation around the points system and the premature expiration of bonus points have been especially frustrating, and our inability to use the timeshare for intended purposes like our honeymoon has been a significant letdown. Weve also discovered that the promised flexibility of using points wherever affiliated with the company was not as simple as suggested in the sales pitch. The credit score impact and the hidden third-party credit card add to our concerns regarding the timeshares ethical practices, and we believe these issues warrant serious examination.

In light of these additional points, we hope our situation is given a thorough review and that we receive a fair and timely resolution, one that acknowledges the emotional and financial distress this timeshare has caused.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,LA,71107,None,Consent provided,Web,11/12/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10772604

I received a response from Citibank dated XX/XX/year>. The response did NOT resolve the complaint. The company 's response continued to confirm that they failed to apply the extra payments to the highest interest rate balance ( Balance Transfer Offer XXXX ) as required by their policies and regulations. The company 's response states that interest rates listed on the prior statement are applicable rates to determine which balance portion has the highest rate. The company states a good "" rule '' is to wait until the statement has cycled to make extra payments. Their "" rule '' is clearly only beneficial to Citibank for charging higher rates of interest.This "" rule '' also appears to conflict with their policies and federal regulations. 

To be clear, the company 's response contradicts the actual interest charges made to the account. If the company 's response were accurate, the rate on Balance Transfer Offer XXXX would not have been 26+ % as of XX/XX/year>, because it was 0 % on the prior statement. The company would also not have charged interest of {$99.00} ; Interest they now offer to refund as a "" courtesy ''. The company appears to be using their "" prior statement rule '' for extra payments as it benefits them because they are definitely not using the "" prior statement rule '' for charging interest to the consumer. Based on this "" rule '', the consumer can not pay off a higher interest rate balance until the next statement, ensuring Citi is able to charge interest to the consumer during that time period.

1. The cardmember agreement does not specify the method the company will use to apply payments ( based on prior statement rate or the rate on actual date of payment ).

2. The customer service representative assured me on XX/XX/year> that the extra payment would be applied to Balance Transfer Offer XXXX ( the highest interest rate balance ) and that my previous extra payment had also been applied to that higher rate balance.

3. Federal regulations require extra payments be applied to the highest interest rate balance first.

4. Company correspondence continues to confirm that the company 's records clearly reflected the higher interest rate on Balance Transfer Offer XXXX on XX/XX/year>, the date of the extra payment, ( because they started charging interest on XX/XX/year> ).

Date Discrepancies : Date Opened has two different entries : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ). This inconsistency may affect the accuracy of the report. 
Date Last Active and Last Reported both show XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Its unclear which date should be the final reporting date. 
XXXX. Account Status and Payment Status : The Account Status is listed as Derogatory without specifics on the nature of the derogatory status ( such as collection or charge-off ).

Payment Status is inconsistent, showing Collection/Chargeoff in one place and Collection in another.

Clarifying this would help with consistency.

3. Consumer Statement and Comments : The consumer statement, I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ACCOUNT, conflicts with the comment Account information disputed by consumer, meets FCRA requirements. It might benefit from clarity on whether the dispute was resolved or remains open.

4. Credit Limit and Past Due : Credit Limit and Past Due are blank or set as -, which might be incomplete. Typically, past due amounts or balances are specified, especially for derogatory accounts.

5. Two-Year Payment History : The payment history doesnt indicate any specific delinquency markers ( e.g., CO for charge-off ) that should match the derogatory status. Including more detail would give a clearer picture of missed payments or other issues.

6. Inconsistent Account Information Across Bureaus : The account type and account status may vary between bureaus, which can lead to confusion and inaccuracies in reporting.

7. Legal References ( FCRA 15USC 1681| ( 5 ) ( A ) ) : Its unclear why this legal reference is included without context. It may indicate a consumer dispute or a compliance check, but further clarification would help.

To improve accuracy, these areas could benefit from review and standardization.

Based on the information provided, here are potential Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) violations, as well as incomplete and inaccurate data points : Potential FCRA Violations 1. Inconsistent Reporting Dates Across Bureaus : The Date Opened differs across bureaus, listed as XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ). The FCRA requires accurate and consistent reporting of account information, so this discrepancy could violate FCRA accuracy requirements. 
XXXX. Inconsistent Last Reported and Date Last Active : The Last Reported date is listed as XX/XX/XXXX in some parts and XX/XX/XXXX elsewhere. The FCRA requires that the information reported to credit bureaus is updated accurately and uniformly across agencies.

3. Missing Monthly Payment Information : The Monthly Payment field is blank, which may violate FCRA completeness requirements if this information is relevant to the account status.

4. Consumer Statement vs. Comments : The consumers statement, I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ACCOUNT, conflicts with the comment Account information disputed by consumer, meets FCRA requirements. If the dispute is unresolved or inaccurately represented as resolved, this could violate FCRAs requirement for the accurate reflection of disputed information.

Incomplete or Inaccurate Data Points 1. Blank Credit Limit and Past Due Fields : Both the Credit Limit and Past Due fields are blank, which may be incomplete data if these fields are expected for a collection account. 
XXXX. Account Type Consistency : Although both XXXX and XXXX list the account type as Collection, XXXX type is unspecified here. Consistency across bureaus would improve clarity and accuracy in reporting. 
XXXX. Two-Year Payment History Missing Delinquency Markers : The two-year payment history shows no delinquency indicators ( such as CO for charge-off ) to match the derogatory status. Including specific delinquency markers for months in which payments were missed or the account was in collections would make the history more accurate. 
XXXX. Date of Last Payment Missing for XXXX : The Date of Last Payment field is empty or missing for XXXX, which could be important data for verifying the most recent payment history. 
Additional Observations Ambiguous Status with Collection/Chargeoff Designation : The accounts status is listed as Collection/Chargeoff and Derogatory, but the exact nature of this designation could be clarified. Clear differentiation between a collection and a charge- off status helps ensure accurate reporting.

In addition, my personal information has been compromised in the recent XXXX and XXXX XXXX data breaches. As a result, my sensitive dataincluding social security number, financial account details, and other personal identifiershas been exposed on the dark web. These breaches have made me vulnerable to identity theft, and I believe my information may have been fraudulently used or mishandled in connection with these collection accounts. Due to the risk of inaccurate reporting and the potential for fraudulent debt, I request that all disputed accounts be promptly removed from my credit file. 

Accounts in Dispute : Receivable Management Account Number : XXXX Balance : $ XXXX Basis for Deletion 1. Lack of Verification Under the FCRA These accounts were disputed with each collection agency, and none of them provided valid proof of my obligation to these debts as required under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681i. According to Section 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ), any information that can not be verified must be promptly deleted from my credit report.

2. Compromised Personal Information Due to Recent Data Breaches As a victim of the recent XXXX and XXXX XXXX data breaches, my personal information has been exposed on the dark web. This breach has compromised my identity, and I have reason to believe that the accounts listed above may be inaccurate or the result of fraud. Exposing my credit file to potentially false and damaging information places me at further risk of financial harm. Given this background, I urge you to take this matter seriously and remove these accounts from my report under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, which provides consumers with rights to block fraudulent information resulting from identity theft.

Action Requested I request that each account listed above be deleted from my credit report with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 
Please provide a written confirmation of these deletions and an updated copy of my credit report, reflecting the removal of these unverified and potentially fraudulent accounts.

The reporting of this account without the issuance of a 1099-C form is both misleading and a violation of my rights under federal law.

Background The account in question was charged off by the creditor, which legally classifies the balance as canceled debt and, therefore, taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) 6050P. According to this provision, creditors are required to issue a 1099-C form for canceled debts exceeding {$600.00}, allowing the debtor to report it as income to the IRS. However, I have not received a 1099-C for this account, yet the creditor continues to report the balance to the credit reporting agencies as an active charge-off.

Legal Basis for Complaint Violation of IRC 6050P- The Internal Revenue Code mandates that creditors report canceled debts exceeding {$600.00} to the IRS and provide debtor with a 1099-C form. The failure to issue this form not only prevents me from properly reporting my taxable income but also raises concerns about the creditor 's adherence to federal law.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) : Creditors and furnishers are obligated to report accurate information to credit reporting agencies. Reporting a charged-off account as delinquent without issuing the legally required 1099-C creates an inconsistency between the IRS classification and the creditor 's reporting practices, constituting inaccurate reporting under the FCRA.

Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) 1036 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : It is considered an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice ( UDAAP ) to report a charged-off account as collectible or delinquent the creditor 's reporting practices, constituting inaccurate reporting under the FCRA.",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,LJ Ross Associates,MD,206XX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/22/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10898083

11/12/2024,Debt collection,Rental debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"Discharged Debt : A discharged debt typically means that the debtor is no longer legally obligated to pay it. In bankruptcy, the discharge is granted by the bankruptcy court under 11 U.S.C. 727 ( in XXXX  XXXX bankruptcy ) or other relevant provisions. If the debt is discharged in bankruptcy, creditors, including third-party debt collectors, can not continue collection efforts unless the discharge order is violated.

3. Proof of Debt and the Wet Signature : A wet signature refers to a traditional signature on a paper document, often used in contracts. In the case of debt collection, it is not always required to prove ownership of a debt, especially if the debt has been sold. However, the third-party debt collector must provide sufficient evidence that they have standing to collect the debt, which may include proving the assignment of the debt from the original creditor.

Under FDCPA, if a debt collector is attempting to collect on a debt, they must be able to validate the debt if disputed by the consumer ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ). This can include showing documentation, though it may not require a wet signature on a contract. However, if no agreement or assignment exists ( i.e., the third party can not prove they legally own the debt ), they may not have standing to collect.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq.

Bankruptcy Code : 11 U.S.C. 524 ( Discharge injunction ) and 11 U.S.C. 727 ( Discharge in XXXX  XXXX ). 
State laws may also provide additional protections, such as requiring more specific documentation or disclosures when debts are sold or transferred.

In summary, if the debt has been discharged through bankruptcy, a third-party collector can not pursue the debt, regardless of whether they have a wet signature or other documentation. If the debt has not been discharged but the collector can not prove ownership or provide appropriate documentation, they may not have the right to collect.

Said Notice contains, false, deceptive and misleading representations, and allegations intended to pervert the truth for the purpose of inducing me, in reliance upon such, to part with property belonging to me and to surrender certain substantive legal and constitutional rights.

This is constructive notice that, absent the validation of your claim within 30 days, you must cease and desist any and all collection activity and are prohibited from contacting me, through the mail, by telephone, in person, at my home, or at my work. Your failure to do so will result in charges being filed against you with the State and Federal regulatory agencies empowered with enforcement.

I believe this situation has been handled negligently by both the bank and my financial institution, and I am seeking your assistance in resolving the matter. 

Here are the details of the situation : Date of Incident : XX/XX/2024 Location : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ATM, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL ATM Withdrawal Amount : {$100.00} ( XXXX atm ) the day prior XX/XX/2024 on XX/XX/2024, I had a transaction of : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and another XXXX ( {$540.00} ) on XX/XX/2024 all while I had my card on my body at work with no one else having access to my information. 
Account Number : XXXX - Physical card On XX/XX/2024, I discovered unauthorized transactions on my account after my card was skimmed at the ATM. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, the operator of the ATM, to report the fraudulent activity. However, they were unable to assist me due to the fact that my card was issued by a third-party bank, MoneyLion. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX did not take any steps to rectify the situation or investigate the claim further. 

I subsequently filed a dispute with my bank, MoneyLion, providing them with all the necessary documentation to prove my case. This included an affidavit from my employer, confirming that I was actively at work over XXXX miles away from the location of the ATM at the time of the fraudulent withdrawal. Additionally, I confirmed that I had my card on me, which further supports the claim that my card was skimmed at the ATM. 

Despite providing this affidavit and other relevant information, MoneyLion denied my dispute, citing that I did not have sufficient details to support my claim. This decision has left me frustrated and without recourse, as I have done everything in my power to prove that my card was compromised due to the negligence of XXXX XXXX XXXX  in securing their ATM. 

I am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in reviewing this matter, as I believe that both XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and MoneyLion have failed in their responsibilities to properly address and resolve this fraudulent activity. I am seeking a resolution in which I am reimbursed for the unauthorized transaction and that proper steps are taken to ensure such incidents are prevented in the future.

11/13/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Non-sufficient funds and associated fees,"This has been going on for over eight months I have requested help and have been on the phone since XX/XX/XXXX, at least 2 to 3 hours a day. They will transfer me six times and then hang up on me. They have these tactics that have become totally predictable. Finally I was able to reach some corporate office who said they would have my issue resolved by XX/XX/XXXX that came again with the phone calls every single day multiple times being told I was on hold in the wrong department transferred never getting anywhere eventually told there is no department for this escalated complaint just request for me to be called which I did 14 times before I was called back once it's resolved and it's nowhere near the complaint that I filed. I know this was done intentionally because I read the complaint over the phone which was two sentences when I close my account the teller agreed if my wife and I make XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars a month these bills should be paid without problem, so at that time the teller put in a request for my account to be reviewed the next day closed account which I had frozen had {$1200.00} in it that I've been trying to get the rest of my account reviewed. It is never sent on a statement that I've had fees and suddenly have printed off my statement and sent it to me and it says I had {$2800.00} bounced check and late fees. This is only because the mortgage and HELOC department would put my payment in and then would pull my back out I have had automatic payment and platinum checking account for U.S. Bank for 24 years. I have not missed one payment in my mortgage and I have not missed one HELOC payment. In less than 30 days, they had already contacted the credit bureau and my wife and I who had credit of XXXX and above are now at XXXX so when I was leaving the bank, I couldn't go get another mortgage if I wanted to because the rates would be so bad. I have since gotten a letter saying that that was done correctly, but they are no longer reporting to the credit bureau which to me, seems incredibly backwards that now it can be two months late and not reported, but it can be reported before they even try contacting me and before my statement even comes out. They were making financial decisions on my behalf. My wife got paid that Monday if they had just left the payment in I would've rather paid the fee which there has never been platinum before but now suddenly I'm being hit with all these fees. It's aggressive banking tactics and it's simply because I'm complaining and asking questions that I can not get answered, so far is perhaps my wife is taking money out and I just am not realizing it at which point I asked them to point where is that money coming out then this has nearly ruined my family. They can never say it wasn't strategic because I have a house in XXXX and it's one of the only other payments they had returned yet the fees remain consistent. I'm getting fees for things that weren't bounced {$2800.00} and six months charged which suddenly now show up on my my statement, after closing my account in that banker who decided to help me who since no longer works there, I hope to XXXX that was by his choice, but to me that seems like an admission of guilt and that they refused to go back any further because of some law have the problem with that is these tactics were done Slowly and methodically take small amounts of cash out of my account. It got to point where I was bouncing checks. Well if I can only go back 30 days and it had been happening for eight months that's that doesn't help with consumer and currently I am at XXXX and need help. I have thought about a class action lawsuit because it seems to be the only way the bank will pay attention and can be hit by a significant amount of money to care. They laugh at me when my response is to literally break down in tears. They know that they will never do a thing about it and they transfer me and try to upset me which never works and I'm always gon na call back so I wish at some point, they would stop the tactics and at least allow me to file some sort of complaint, it's ridiculous and transactions. The last letter I got from the HELOC department is flowered with apologies but no admission of any problem. They've also spun words in such a way that a nurse and an educator couldn't figure out what was wrong with the account if they spent a year trying.

I am signed up for Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX and the company continually sends my account negative despite the funds being readily available in my savings account.

The issue is that this does not align with their own policy. This is not a free service to my memory and they set the policy and they are the ones breaking it at my expense with no apology or regard for the damage caused. Being that Wells Fargo has a history of being predatory towards its own customers I can only imagine how many others deal with this issue.

11/15/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding my recent experiences with my checking and savings accounts at Citibank, specifically related to the handling of a third-party check deposit and subsequent access to my funds. 

I opened both accounts not long ago, accompanied by my wife, and made an initial deposit. During this process, I inquired about Citibank 's policy on third-party checks and was assured by a banker that such checks are accepted. As part of my responsibilities, I manage financial matters for my father-in-law, who is a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX. ). This arrangement necessitates regular deposits of his monthly checks into my account to cover his medical expenses, including medications and necessary equipment. 

Typically, I wait the standard clearance period of three to five business days for deposits. After confirming that a recent deposit had cleared, I proceeded to a nearby gas station, where I used my ATM debit card without issue. I called and listened to my available balance on my account which amounted close to {$10000.00} However, upon visiting the bank to transfer {$4000.00} to my savings account and withdraw {$2000.00} for my father-in-law 's needs, I encountered unexpected difficulties. After hearing my request of how much money i needed the teller gave me scowl type of look ; i felt she was judging me, made a phone call, and subsequently, another bank representative arrived, resulting in the blocking of my funds and my debit card. I was informed that I needed to provide further verification. 

This incident caused significant distress, as it prevented me from accessing necessary funds for my father-in-law 's medications. I am perplexed as to why my account was restricted following a normal transaction at the gas station. The only explanation I can discern is the potential perception stemming from my XXXX identity as a XXXX man withdrawing funds from my account. 

Having reviewed Citibanks policies, I understand that third-party checks are accepted, and I find the restrictions placed on my account both unwarranted and discriminatory. The bank informed me that they would issue a check for the remaining balance of {$9800.00} once the account was closed, a process which, I was told, could take 30 to 90 days. Meanwhile, my father-in-law has been left without the funds necessary to meet his medical needs. This extended delay, combined with the restricted access to our funds, has left us unable to address his essential expenses. I have not yet taken out any loans, hoping for an expedient resolution. 

As the delay continued, I grew increasingly concerned and placed a call to the branch where I opened the account. I inquired about the status of my remaining funds and the promised check from the fraud department. According to the sales representative, the computer system indicated that the check for {$9800.00} was scheduled to be sent on XX/XX/year>, to the last address on public file. But i had received a closeout letter saying my account was closed but he says theres an account balance of XXXX something dollars in it. How and why is it not being sent to me in a form of a check. its been over three months. However, I have not yet received this check, nor any further communication regarding the matter. 


Following this experience, I have decided to close my accounts with Citibank. I was disappointed to discover that my account was closed without the return of my funds or any further communication regarding this matter. 

I would appreciate your prompt attention to this issue and would like to request the immediate release of my remaining balance, as well as any additional clarification regarding the handling of my account. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NV,89119,None,Consent provided,Web,11/15/2024,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,10812651

Below are the details of my complaint : Issue Summary : After closing my account with U.S. Bank, they issued me a check for the remaining balance.

As a federally protected consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., I am exercising my rights concerning the privacy of my personal information and the accuracy of my credit report.

The FCRA mandates that CRAs must follow reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality of credit information and promote accuracy, fairness, and the privacy of personal information. Notably, 15 U.S.C. 1681a states that it is illegal to report transaction history on a credit report, as the Act excludes reports that contain information solely about transactions or experiences between the consumer and the reporting entity. 
Given the inaccuracies in my credit report, I am opting out of any and all authorization for the reporting or sharing of any information related to the accounts inaccurately reported. This includes any written, unwritten, verbal, or nonverbal authorization I may have provided, in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 6802 and 16 CFR Part 313, which govern the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information. 
Due to the violations of my rights under the FCRA and the impact on my creditworthiness, I am demanding immediate updates to my credit report to correct these inaccuracies. I expect these updates to be made as soon as possible, in compliance with the FCRAs accuracy standards. Should these updates not be made, I will be seeking compensation for the violation of my rights as outlined under 15 U.S.C. 6801-6805, 16 CFR Part 313, and 15 U.S.C. 1692k. I am prepared to pursue legal remedies should my demands not be met.

To resolve this matter, I require the following : Immediate correction of the inaccurately reported account ( s ) on my credit report to comply with the FCRAs standards.

Compensation for the violation of my rights under the FCRA and related statutes due to the mishandling of my personal information. 
Written confirmation of the actions taken to address my requests as required under the FCRA. 
Failure to address these concerns will compel me to take further legal action to protect my rights and seek full compensation for the damages incurred.

I purchased jewelry from JCPenney in XX/XX/XXXX. I went to return the item On XX/XX/XXXX. I was refused a refund because the store manager said I exceeded the return policy of 60 days.

I was told by the clerk that I should have gone online to review the policy, however I purchased my item in store, I simply wanted to return the ring and have the credit refunded to my card.

11/8/2024,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I switched my home insurance company a few weeks ago. I was with XXXX and it was XXXX I am with XXXX and it is XXXX now. I did send back the check XXXX gave me to My mortgage company and it was posted to my account. My mortgage was {$720.00} and now it is {$700.00}. The whole reason I searched days for a cheaper home insurance was because I could not afford to pay that high of a mortgage. When I first called I spoke to someone and she started saying I had another reassessment and that I was not able to get a lower payment. When I asked why she started quoting off numbers but none of it made sense as to why it would not be lowered. I called again and asked for them to reevaluate my escrow. She said she would submit to have that done and that I would know something by the XXXX that is the latest I have to pay my mortgage without a late payment so I could pay the lower amount that month. I even called the insurance agent and even she was baffled. She then suggested that I call again so I called today and the rep offered to submit to have it reevaluated. I informed her that the last rep said she would do! She looked into and came back and said that she would submit it again. She said I had to pay the {$700.00} now and then by next month it should change some. I am very upset I told her I can not afford to pay that and that I did not feel it was right to make me pay a higher amount when they know I dont deserve to pay it! I am also upset that when I call I keep getting the same response that they will submit it again. My insurance was cut almost in half and they keep trying to convince me that it should not be lowered much more than it was. I keep calling and talking to reps but I am getting no where. It is very frustrating that I am trying to resolve this issue so I can have a more affordable payment but they can tell me I should not get it lowered by much. I dont know what to do! They just throw some numbers to try to explain it and you are left feeling helpless because if you dont pay the amount they tell even if it is wrong you will defaulting but then they will offer you a payment plan that will be lower but you will end up paying more and longer.

This inquiry was conducted without my consent or any permissible purpose, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Description of the Issue : On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank N.A./THD accessed my credit report without my authorization. Under the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681b, a consumers credit report can only be accessed for permissible purposes, which require express written consent from the consumer. At no time did I provide such consent to Citibank N.A./THD, nor did I engage in any business transaction that would justify this inquiry. 

Impact on Me : The unauthorized inquiry has caused the following harm : 1. Negative impact on my credit score, which could affect my ability to obtain credit or favorable terms.

2. Unnecessary financial stress, as I have had to address this matter and dispute the inquiry.

Resolution Sought : I respectfully request the CFPBs assistance in the following : 1. Investigate this unauthorized hard inquiry made by Citibank N.AXXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. Require Citibank N.A./THD to remove this inquiry from my credit report immediately. 
3. Ensure Citibank N.A./THD complies with federal laws and provides written confirmation of the removal and corrective actions taken.

Citibank N.A./THDs actions are in direct violation of my rights under the FCRA, and despite my attempts to address this issue directly, no resolution has been provided. 

I trust the CFPB will investigate thoroughly and take the necessary steps to protect my rights as a consumer. Thank you for your attention to this serious matter.

11/21/2024,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I recently filed complaint against XXXX and Zions Collections because they are trying to collect for services I cancelled and paid. I explained how I tried cancelling for months in XXXX, and they keep billing me over and over. I explained how I made a final payment months after I tried cancelling, and they still keep billing. 

I then showed proof of my cancel notices and certified mail receipts of cancelled notices to Brinks and to other collectors who were collecting. Finally, I showed proof I tried to dispute this with XXXX and they still keep collecting. I then file a complaint with your agency showing you XXXX still keeps trying to cheat me and collect on something I cancelled. 

You know what XXXX does? XXXX says my cancelation is invalid because I was past due in XXXX and I tried cancelling in XXXX. It is the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life. What do you mean my cancelation is invalid? They have to accept my cancelation no matter how much money I owe. So just because someone is a past month due, they can't cancel services? So, a company can just keep billing someone forever? We both know that is not true, but the collection is making that stupid excuse to YOU to keep breaking the law and keep trying to collect from me. Now they are saying if I pay this in full, they will delete it. But why should I pay for something I don't owe, already paid, and cancelled numerous times? 

And their excuse is stupid for other reasons too. Even if I was late in XXXX when I cancelled in XXXX, the paperwork they showed me with all the payments says I paid them in full {$320.00} in XXXX and there was {$0.00} balance. That is after I already cancelled Brinks in XXXX in writing. If I cancelled them in XXXX, and I paid them in full in XXXX, then why they keep billing me after that? I will now show you their stupid response they filed to you and their new e-mail trying to have me pay them. 

Must I hire lawyer to sue them? Do they just get to say lies to you and get away with it? Does this complaint even do anything? Please help me to get them to stop collecting this debt I do not owe.

11/5/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card,"Attention : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the President, Barclays XXXX XXXX [ last name undisclosed ] Regrettfully, the one-year-long dispute remains unresolved, despite Barclays statements to the contrary. 

The issue, first reported on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, is an overcharge in the amount {$280.00}. I NEVER claimed that the merchant altered the amount charged on my account, as Barclays incorrectly alleges in its XX/XX/XXXX letter. More than once, I provided Barclays with the merchants own receipt of payment in the amount of {$13000.00}. Barclays, on the other hand, charged my account {$13000.00}. These are and remain the facts. This overcharge by Barclays is what I have been disputing since XX/XX/XXXX. The question is simple and remains : Why does Barclays pay a merchant one amount and charge its client a higher amount? Please explain. 

Barclays claims to have resolved the claim in my favor, because it did the following without my authorization : As per the merchant, Barclays contacted the merchant, reversed or cancelled its original XX/XX/XXXX payment to the merchant in the amount of {$13000.00}, and then paid the merchant {$13000.00}. Meanwhile, I had paid Barclays {$13000.00}, as Barclays acknowledges in its XX/XX/XXXX letter. The credit Barclays claims to have provided basically allows for the charge on my account to be {$13000.00} ( what I paid ) instead of Barclays original charge on the account of {$13000.00}. However, since Barclays received {$13000.00} from me and subsequently reversed and paid the merchant about {$13000.00}, Barclays continues to overcharge me. It then suggests that I bring up the matter with the merchant, attempting to distance itself from the dispute. Yet, the unanswered question persists : Why does Barclays pay a merchant one amount and charge its client a higher amount?

Despite Barclays comments regarding foreign exchange, Barclays is still overcharging me {$280.00} and subsequently the merchant is now contacting me and demanding payment of such difference. I reiterate, Barclays is still overcharging me in the amount of {$280.00}, and NO, the dispute was not resolved in my favor. As also explained in my previous complaint, the merchant happens to be my health insurance provider. Thus, Barclays has put my health insurance coverage at risk. 

Since I have never been fortunate enough to contact XXXX XXXX nor any of her/his Barclays colleagues via the direct line nor receive return calls within the 48 hours stated on the Barclays recording , I am forced to file this CFPB complaint in further attempt to resolve the matter. 

If customer service is very important to Barclays, as it states in one of its letter, and if it honestly regret [ s ] the hardship it is imposing upon me, as it also expresses in one of its letter, then Barclays will have the respect to fully and honestly answer the questions posed above and return to me the amount of the overcharge.

Email 2 Right after submitting the transfer request I requested to cancel it, because on the international transfer confirmation email the recipient bank was stated as Wells Fargo instead of XXXX. The foreign bank tells me the transfer is sent and can not be canceled. 

After this, I learned that given the size of XXXX, they do not process the transfer themselves but use Wells Fargo instead. Which explains the confusion when I was inputting the XXXX code.

11/9/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Dear CFPB, I am filing a formal complaint against La Curacao for their failure to respond to my dispute letter dated XX/XX/year>, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). In this letter, I specifically requested that La Curacao investigate disputed items on my credit report, provide a full audit trail, and remove any unverifiable or inaccurate information as required by law. 

Under the FCRA, particularly 15 U.S.C. Section 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ), credit furnishers like La Curacao are required to investigate a dispute and report back to the consumer within 30 days. As of today, I have received no response from La Curacao, nor have they taken action to investigate, provide the requested audit trail, or update my credit report to reflect accurate information. 

Relevant FCRA Violations 1. Failure to Investigate : Under Section 1681s-2 ( b ), La Curacao , as a furnisher of information, is required to conduct an investigation into any disputed information once they receive notice from the consumer. This includes verifying the accuracy of the information or deleting any information that can not be substantiated. La Curacaos failure to investigate or respond to my dispute directly violates this FCRA requirement. 
2. Failure to Report Investigation Results : According to 15 U.S.C. Section 1681i ( a ) ( 6 ), a credit furnisher must provide the consumer with the results of the reinvestigation within the specified timeframe. La Curacaos lack of response constitutes non-compliance with this requirement. 
3. Lack of an Audit Trail : In my dispute, I requested an audit trail and supporting documentation used to verify the disputed items. Under FCRA requirements, furnishers are obligated to provide any documentation that substantiates the accuracy of the information in question. By failing to do so, La Curacao has prevented me from verifying the accuracy of the information they reported.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,ADIR INTERNATIONAL LLC,NV,89183,None,Consent provided,Web,11/9/2024,Closed with explanation,No,N/A,10742877

I called Fair Capital and shared my confirmation number from paying the bills in XXXX and they could see that the payment was in fact made but that XXXX never notified them. 

My complaint against XXXX is that by not keeping and communicating good records on bills and payments, they put their patient 's credit and money at risk. Because their third party debt collection agency threatens a ding on your credit score, some patients might incorrectly pay a balance for a second time when the balance has actually been cleared out. 

My complaint about Fair Capital is that if they were able to look up my payment of the debt, their system should not allow them to send subsequent notices that I have an outstanding balance.

However, he then informed me that the {$1.00} credit would be to the account and would not be available until another 5 days.

This complaint is to address Wells Fargo for taking {$1300.00} out of my account after advising that after a certain amount of time all is right with the world Ive banked with for over 20 years and have never had anything like this happen before Ive always been under the assumption that the money is a bank is insured for issues just like this I have all texts and emails if you require them but what they have done to me is detrimental to my health and finances I am going to be unable to pay my bills and I have XXXX medical procedures coming up",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,270XX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/6/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10721408

This correspondence serves as a notice of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

I would like to bring to your attention that, under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), consumers have the right to dispute any information in their credit report that they believe is inaccurate or incomplete. I believe that the charge-off designation on my account is misleading and improperly represented for the following reasons : 1. IRS Conclusions on Charge-Offs : The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) has concluded that a charge-off can be considered income to a debtor under certain circumstances. However, this should be reported accurately through a Form 1099-C ( Cancellation of Debt ) if applicable. To date, I have not received a 1099-C concerning this debt, which calls into question the legitimacy of the charge-off being reported. As such, it should not be treated as a completed transaction as it lacks adequate documentation. 

2. Reporting of Late Payments : The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that all information reported to credit bureaus must be accurate and reflect the true payment history. If [ Creditor 's Name ] has reported late payments leading up to the charge-off, I demand verification of these claims. If accurate payment history exists, it should not have been misrepresented as an accumulation of late payments leading to a charge-off. 

3. FDCPA Compliance : Furthermore, I would like to assert my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). If [ Creditor 's Name ] or any collection agency that reports on this account has failed to provide adequate validation of the debt when requested, this can be deemed a violation of my rights under the FDCPA as well. 

Given these points, I request a detailed investigation into this matter. I ask that you provide documentation of the charge-off, proof that a 1099-C has been issued to the IRS, and verification of any late payments or outstanding balances. If you can not provide such documentation, I request that you immediately correct the reporting of this account with the credit bureaus.

Per 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ), your failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of all necessary information prior to furnishing details to consumer reporting agencies further substantiates the illegal practices you are engaged in.

P.s. My NEXT letter will be a notification of my LOITS! So that you do not need for a legal dictionary, a LOITS notice is a Letter Of Intent To Suit! You BEST be PROVEN COMPLIANT to ALL requirements and standards of FCRA COMPLIANCE and also of the implemented XXXX enacted CDIA implemented Metro 2 Compliance mandates as well. I will demand verification that each employee at your firm which MIGHT have seen or conducted any business on the file you allege mine has been properly trained by a certified and qualified instructor of the Metro 2 data field formatted reporting standards. I am NOT shy in detailing my DOUBTS you can withstand the requisites to survive a court hearing versus me as I leverage your DEFICIENCIES for a slew of victories being awarded a minimum of {$1000.00} PER VIOLATION PER TIME, and there certainly appears to be a bucket full. So, lets do this! Anything OTHER than your letter describing to me that you have already begun or completed the annulment of these unproven claims versus me and have eradicated ENTIRELY any and all aspects of records of what you allege being mine ( yeah! ) will IMMEDIATE compel me to assume your hostile to my demands of proper reporting and I will assume that your ignorance of appropriate and adequate duties are willful and intentionally injurious. Being such, civil suits are obvious however criminal charges are not out the question, particularly if your chicanery-led subterfuge brings forth or allows.

11/11/2024,Debt collection,I do not know,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Sued you in a state where you do not live or did not sign for the debt,"To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, regarding their alleged unfair and unlawful collection practices, as well as potential violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. This complaint specifically addresses XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  ( the collector ) attempts to collect on a debt purportedly owed to Citibank N.A., and Citibanks alleged issuance of a 1099-C form to the IRS without notifying me. 

1. Failure to Provide 1099-C Notification : Citibank N.A . appears to have filed a 1099-C form with the IRS in relation to this debt. Under IRS rules, creditors who issue a 1099-C form must provide the debtor with a copy. However, I never received such notice, leaving me unaware of any potential cancellation of debt income reported to the IRS. This oversight may affect the legal status of the alleged debt and my credit report, which under the FCRA must accurately reflect all pertinent information related to a debt. 
2. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXs  actions may be in violation of the FCRA, specifically : Inaccurate Reporting of Debt : The FCRA mandates that credit information must be accurate and complete ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Due to Citibanks apparent filing of a 1099-C, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX may be reporting a debt that has been discharged or forgiven, leading to a potentially inaccurate credit report entry. 
Failure to Provide Debt Validation : Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ), I am entitled to a validation of the debt. However, despite my request, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX has failed to provide me with a debt validation letter, creating further uncertainty about the legitimacy of this debt. 
3. Improper Venue and Lack of Jurisdiction to Sue in New York : XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX has filed a lawsuit against me in the state of New York, despite the fact that I am a resident of Ohio. This filing is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692i, which requires debt collectors to bring legal action either in the district where the consumer resides or where the contract was signed. Since I do not reside in New York and did not sign the contract in New York, this lawsuit constitutes an improper venue and is thus unlawful. 
4. Lack of Authorization to Collect in New York : XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX has yet to provide evidence of their authorization to collect this debt in New York, where they have initiated litigation. Under the FDCPA, debt collectors are required to prove their authority to collect, especially when jurisdiction is in question. I request that they produce documentation establishing their right to pursue this debt collection in New York, in compliance with applicable state laws.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,11434,None,Consent provided,Web,11/11/2024,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,10756378
11/13/2024,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Syncb/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dear SynchronyXXXX XXXX  XXXX, I am writing to formally dispute the reporting of the charge-off account associated with XXXX on my credit report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( Reinvestigation of Disputed Information ), and 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information ), I am entitled to request and receive complete and accurate documentation to verify the accuracy and legality of this accounts reporting. Additionally, under Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act ( Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-201 ) law, I am requesting proper validation of this debt. I would like to highlight several cases that affirm my right to dispute this information and request accurate reporting. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ), the court emphasized the duty of credit reporting agencies and furnishers to ensure the accuracy of the information reported on consumers ' credit reports. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) reinforces the requirement that furnishers conduct proper investigations into disputes and verify the accuracy of their reporting. 

To properly validate this account, I am requesting the following : 1. Authenticated Double-Entry Accounting Records I am requesting full double-entry accounting records for the account mentioned. This should include a detailed breakdown that shows how all transactions were debited and credited, ensuring compliance with standard accounting principles. Please note that I do not wish to receive a simple list of charges or statements. I expect authenticated evidence of the debt. The court ruling in XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) held that mere conclusory statements from debt XXXX or creditors do not satisfy the validation requirement. Only authenticated and verified documentation proving the validity of the debt is acceptable. 

2. Authenticated Evidence Based on Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act ( Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-201 ) Law. In addition to the accounting records, I require authenticated evidence, in compliance with Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act ( Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-201 ) law, that you have the legal right to report and collect this debt. This includes original signed contracts or agreements that show my obligation to pay the debt and your legal right to enforce collection and report it to credit bureaus. Without this evidence, the continued reporting of this debt may constitute a violation of both federal and state consumer protection laws. In XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the court held that creditors must produce original signed documentation to prove the validity of a debt. Failing to provide this evidence may result in a violation of both state and federal consumer protection laws. 

3. 1099-C Form If this debt has been forgiven, canceled, or settled for less than the full balance, I am requesting a copy of the 1099-C form filed with the IRS, which is required if the amount of canceled debt exceeds {$600.00}. If you have not provided this documentation, the debt may be considered discharged, and it should no longer be reported as owed on my credit report. The IRS has clearly outlined the requirements for filing a 1099-C form under 26 U.S.C. 6050P, which applies when a debt of {$600.00} or more is discharged or forgiven. If you have failed to file this form, the continued reporting of this debt may be fraudulent. In the absence of the requested documentation and verifiable evidence, I request that you immediately delete this account from my credit report in compliance with the FCRA and Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act ( Md. Code Ann., Com. Law 14-201 ) law. Failure to do so will result in further action, including filing formal complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), pursuing legal remedies to enforce my rights, and submitting a Suspicious Activity Report ( SAR ) to the IRS for suspicion of fraud. The SAR ( FinCEN Form 111 ) will be filed if you continue reporting inaccurate and unverified information without providing the required documentation.

I have received a 1099-C form for this account, indicating that the debt was canceled. According to the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) 6050P, a 1099-C form is issued when a creditor cancels a debt of {$600.00} or more. This means the debt has been legally forgiven and should no longer be reported as a charge-off. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 611 ( a ), I have the right to dispute any information on my credit report that I believe is inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable. As the debt has been canceled and a 1099-C form has been issued, the reporting of this charge-off is both inaccurate and misleading. I request that you conduct a reinvestigation of this matter under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and remove the charge-off from my credit report. If the information can not be verified, it must be deleted from my credit file according to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Please provide me with written confirmation that this item has been corrected and removed. If you are unable to verify the accuracy of this information, it must be deleted from my credit report as required by law. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

To reduce debt and just have one mortgage instead of multiple credit cards. However, the company charge me {$52.00} to run credit check which is okay. 
XX/XX/24, I was charged {$750.00} which was originally written and stated that it will only cost {$50.00} as they can do a drive by. After a week I was notified that they are not able to XXXX XXXX by and need to charge me {$750.00}. Which I, hesitated to say yes, but due to the process and credit check fee etc, I said yes. 
XX/XX/24 I got a call from underwriter XXXX XXXX to freeze my current XXXX heloc for them to be able to pay it off. This XXXX heloc ( 8 % interest ) was not part of the plan to pay off but the credit cards thats up 22 %. It does not make sense for anyone to pay loan fees and pay off 8 % to 9.75 %. I asked why this was not communicated to me and I was told I only have two option to approve or reject it. I rejected it and requested the {$750.00} appraisal that I paid as I feel like they did not do their due diligence in checking eligibility and now I further accrued more debt, not to mention because of the hard credit check my score went down and I'm getting phone calls every 5 minutes from all over the world. 
The issue was XXXX holding a lien on my mortgage and for them to approved my loan they need to clear that lien first. If they would have been honest and told me this from the beginning, I could have avoided all of these.

The contract that was sent to me had different numbers and I asked why that is and was told that they can edit it on their end but need my signature before they can proceed. Very sketchy process but I trusted them and now paying for it.

I NEVER used this card and the card was stolen from my home in its original envelope from XXXX. Because that was all that was stolen I did not know it was gone from my files. The thief contacted XXXX to change my contact information, therefore notification of the fraudulent use of my card was not known to me until XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called XXXX XXXX XXXX to report the theft. I spoke to XXXX XXXX in XXXX Collections who transferred me to XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX. he stated my card had been used to charge {$3400.00}. I asked XXXX to close my XXXX XXXX account and to block any further use of it to avoid any further problems with XXXX. XXXX went through each of the charges and asked me to say whether or not each charge was mine and I stated I did not make any of the charges as I had never used the card. I asked to be mailed a statement as I had never seen nor expected a statement as I never had used the card. He stated that the investigation team would investigate and get back to me by XX/XX/XXXX until the investigation is closed that it would be resolved. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notice that the case was resolved. I thought at that time that the issue was done. XXXX had stated that Barclays would contact the credit rating companies to correct the report. 
This case resulted in my excellent credit rating downgrade due to negative hit from past due bill since the credit card company did not suspend the charge while investigation was ongoing. I had filed an identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to report the incident and protect myself from identity theft should something arise in the future. The reference number is : XXXX. 
I contacted Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to an agent named XXXX after I was contacted by XXXX XXXX a collection agency, stating that my account was sold to them for collections. XXXX at Barclays stated that there were a few charges they needed me to confirm that I hadnt charged and were fraudulent which I did. I asked XXXX to send me written motivation of the status of the investigation and for a reason the account was sold to XXXX XXXX before the investigation was complete. I have not received anything from XXXX telling me about their investigation. There is no way there is any substantiation that these charges are mine. Prior to this issue I have had an excellent credit rating. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Barclays again to find out the outcome of the additional investigation charges and spoke to agent XXXX  who initially had no information, but said I should contact another number which I saw was XXXX XXXX  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there were none available. I asked him to have a supervisor contact me and he said he would put in a follow up but would not explain how I would be contacted. Because I have received no info other than my case was concluded and written off by XXXX, I am concluding that my case was never investigated before being sent to collection. Because if it was investigated they would find that the charges were not made by me. Id like to note that my research shows that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took action against XXXX XXXX XXXX and ordered them to pay {$24.00} million dollars for violations of the law in collecting on unsubstantiated debt. I am appalled that there was no follow up or investigation done.

11/6/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"Executive Summary : Citibank closed my credit card account without my knowledge and with no reason, resulting in forfeiture of {$1100.00} cash value worth of rewards points that I had built up over a period more than 10 years. I believe that this is a UDAAP violation, with unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The subject credit card has an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX, I never missed a payment, and I have excellent credit, with credit scores consistently over XXXX. Therefore, there was no legitimate reason to close the account. I tried to reason with the Citibank Customer Service Representatives ( CSR ) and Supervisors for several hours on the phone for a reasonable resolution but to no avail. I believe that this is a common tactic of corporate stonewalling by deterring the consumer to come to a resolution due to many layers of deterrence. This situation is basically a large corporation ( Citibank ) stealing from the consumer ( me, and potentially others with the same situation ). In summary, closing my account and forfeiting my points is effectively theft by Citibank. 


Potential UDAAP violations : While this issue does not pertain to the collection of a consumer debt, the following describes how this situation meets all three of the Applicable Standards for UDAAPs. 

XXXX. Unfair Acts or Practices The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits conduct that constitutes an unfair act or practice. An act or practice is unfair when : ( XXXX ) It causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers ; ( XXXX ) The injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers ; and ( XXXX ) The injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. 

The injury is monetary, in the amount of {$1100.00}. I couldnt avoid the injury, as they closed my account and took my points/cash value. 

XXXX. Deceptive Acts or Practices The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits conduct that constitutes a deceptive act or practice. An act or practice is deceptive when : ( XXXX ) The act or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer ; ( XXXX ) The consumers interpretation is reasonable under the circumstances; and ( XXXX ) The misleading act or practice is material. 

The deceptive act or practice is the stealing ( forfeiture ) of my points for no reason, when I had an open credit card with no delinquencies and good credit. 


XXXX. Abusive Acts or Practices The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits conduct that constitutes an abusive act or practice. An act or practice is abusive when it : ( XXXX ) Materially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service; or ( XXXX ) Takes unreasonable advantage of ( A ) a consumers lack of understanding of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service; ( B ) a consumers inability to protect his or her interests in selecting or using a consumer financial product or service; or ( C ) a consumers reasonable reliance on a covered person to act in his or her interests. 

The abusive act or practice is theft of my points that have a cash value of {$1100.00}. 

Additional Details : Prior to filing this complaint, I tried very hard to come to what I thought was a very reasonable resolution to the issue. I simply wanted Citibank to either reinstate my credit card with my points or issue me the cash value of those points at {$1100.00}. As previously stated, I accumulated the points over a period more than 10 years. In XX/XX/XXXX, I called a Citibank CSR and inquired about my points. During that conversation, the CSR informed me that the points never expire. In addition, I was never informed that my account would be closing. In XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to access my account to use some of my points, however, I could not access my points. I then spent over 4 hours talking to several Citibank CSRs and Supervisors over 3 days, from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. The last person I spoke to was Senior Account Supervisor with Citi Cards in Arizona, with the name of XXXX. In summary, all the CSRs and Supervisors told me that the account had been closed, the points had been forfeited, and there was nothing that they could do. I repeatedly tried to escalate to higher supervisors, but at some point, they refused to escalate it anymore. Here is where I refer to the strategy of corporate stonewalling the strategy of making consumers feel they have no options because the supervisors just basically disregard their reasonable requests. In addition, I strongly believe that this is corporate theft, as CitiBank had no legitimate reason to close my credit card that had an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX. Again, I have strong credit and never had any delinquencies. 

I bring this to the attention of the CFPB not only to recoup the {$1100.00} that I am entitled to, but to highlight this very unfair practice that could be impacting other consumers. These unfair practices should result in civil money penalties and restitution. 

I am only seeking from Citibank a fair resolution to this issue, which would be one of two options : XXXX ) Reopen the credit card, with my point reestablished, or XXXX ) Issue me a check for the cash value of my points, which is {$1100.00}.

2. I was allowed to remain in the unit and subsequently signed two additional leases with the same property after the judgment. These leases further confirm that the matter was fully resolved. 

Attachments : To support my claim, I am including the following documentation : Email correspondence from the apartment complex verifying that the judgment was resolved and no eviction took place. 
Copies of two subsequent leases for the same unit, showing that I continued to reside there without issue. 

Request for Resolution : I am requesting CFPBs intervention to ensure that the reporting agency updates or removes this inaccurate entry from my rental history. Despite my previous efforts to resolve this, the issue remains unresolved, and it is unfairly preventing me from moving into a new home.

I currently hold a mortgage loan with RoundPoint Mortgage Serving LLC. 

Statement : On XX/XX/XXXX a letter was drafted and mailed to me by RoundPoint stating my home require flood insurance due to a flood map revision "" REMAPPING '' issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ). The letter stated "" If proper evidence of acceptable flood insurance is not received within 45 days of the date of this notice, we will purchase coverage at your expense effective XX/XX/XXXX. '' Upon receiving the notice I contacted my insurance agent, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and we secured flood insurance for my home. The policy was submitted to RoundPoint ( see attached and paid by RoundPoint using my RoundPoint escrow account. ) The effective date of the policy is XX/XX/XXXX, which is within the 45 days of the notice. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a letter was drafted and mailed to me by RoundPoint stating "" we have not received the insurance information we previously requested for the property location shown above. At your expense, we have purchased the flood insurance described below to protect our interest in the property, as required by the Flood Disaster protection Act of 1973, as amended, ( FDPA ). '' ( attached ) XX/XX/XXXX, I received the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which stated flood insurance was purchased on my behalf for the period of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$210.00}. This is clearly an error on RoundPoints behalf as I had already secured flood insurance and it was paid by RoundPoint. I called my insurance agency who called RoundPoint and was told it was an error and it will be corrected in 15 days. I also called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX and voiced my dispute as well. I was told that RoundPoint will followup and address the matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, today I received the below email stating an escrow disbursement was made from my escrow account in the amount of {$210.00}. ( attached ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I called roundpoint and advised them about the situation above and expressed I am disputing this matter. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I was told to send an email with my dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX, I prepared my dispute and emailed roundpoint. Roundpoint replied acknowledging receipt of my dispute. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my insurance agency, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX called and spoke with your customer service for 52 minutes. XXXX called XXXX. XXXX requested this matter be escalated and resolved. XXXX advised she was unable to resolve this matter and has exhausted all resources on her end. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed roundpoint and notified them I will be filing a complaint. 

I did not give Roundpoint permission to obtain flood insurance on my behalf. I complied with the notice to obtain flood insurance within 45 days as stated. I did not give roundpoint permission to use my escrow funds to purchase this insurance. 

Roundpoint has been engaged in unfair and abusive practices against me. I respectfully request this matter be investigated and that roundpoint replace the escrow funds they took without my permission ( {$210.00} ) It is not unreasonable for me to believe this has happened to other customers and I beg your agency to look into this matter further.

I made my expected payment of {$1200.00} on XX/XX/year>. Today, XX/XX/year>, I tried to make my payment for XXXX and see that I'm expected to pay {$2700.00} due to my escrow payment now being {$1900.00}. This is a sharp increase from my expected escrow payment of {$490.00}. I called and spoke to a representative who told me this is due to them doing an escrow analysis in XXXX, the same month they were working on my modification. When I brought this to her attention she says that it's an automatic analysis and my modification wasn't taken into account. She then told me they received a huge payment for my escrow, this is because a modification settles your escrow deficit and puts it into a new principal balance. This isn't even the information she knew to tell me but what I know from dealing with the modification myself. She then tells me they sent a check for {$2200.00} saying I had a surplus in my account. However, they're still expecting me to pay {$2700.00} for both XXXX and XXXX each due to an incorrect escrow analysis. When I brought this to her attention she says the extra amount is to bring me out of a deficit. How do I have a deficit when you're sending me a check for a surplus? Overall, my escrow account should be regular. It shouldn't be a surplus or a deficit. Because of them mistakenly sending this check, my escrow account now has a deficit. Please see the attached photo to see how this mistake has messed up my account. Since my loan was transferred to them in XXXX, there have been ongoing issues. From lack of communication leading to me having prolonged missing payments and ruining my credit to applying the master condo insurance to my account instead of my private home insurance.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX XXXX : XXXX XX/XX/year> Subject : Formal Dispute Response to CFPB Complaint To Whom It May Concern, Regarding my CFPB complaint about late payment notations on my credit report. After reviewing your response, I have identified several issues and potential violations of consumer protection laws. I would like to formally dispute the inaccuracies in your reporting and raise concerns regarding your handling of this matter.

Issues with Kikoffs Response 1. Inadequate Proof of Late Payments ( FCRA Violation ) o Your response includes a summary document of dates and amounts but fails to provide verifiable proof of the alleged late payments. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), creditors must ensure that all information they report to credit bureaus is accurate and verifiable. A simple document outlining dates and amounts is insufficient evidence without accompanying transactional records or logs that clearly establish my payment history. 
2. Failure to Notify Adequately o You mention that notifications were sent to "" all customers regarding account status, '' but no evidence has been provided to show that I was specifically and adequately notified about my payment status or potential late remarks prior to their being reported. Lack of sufficient and timely notification may violate fair practice standards and could demonstrate negligence in maintaining open communication with consumers.

3. Misrepresentation of Consumer Rights o Your statement that Kikoff "" can not remove genuine late or missed payments '' misrepresents consumer rights under the FCRA. If late payments are reported inaccurately or without sufficient evidence, they must be removed regardless of whether Kikoff believes them to be "" genuine. '' This misrepresentation undermines my ability to exercise my rights to dispute errors.

4. Failure to Conduct a Thorough Investigation ( FCRA Requirement ) o The FCRA requires data furnishers to perform a reasonable investigation when a dispute is received, especially one filed through the CFPB. Your response does not indicate that a detailed review of the alleged late payments was conducted. Simply reiterating that the payments were "" outside the grace period '' without concrete proof of my payment activity does not meet the standard for a proper investigation.

5. Unclear Terms and Conditions Enforcement o You reference the terms and conditions accepted on XX/XX/year>, but fail to provide specific clauses that justify the reporting of late payments or the process for notifying consumers. Transparency in these agreements is essential to ensure compliance with applicable laws. 
6. Account Closure and Reporting Practices o While you mention that my account is currently closed, you do not clarify whether the closure process was conducted in compliance with regulatory standards or how this impacts the accuracy of your reporting. Reporting closed accounts with disputed late payments may further harm consumers if done inaccurately or without proper justification.

Relevant Case Studies To support my concerns, I reference the following legal precedents that demonstrate the importance of compliance with consumer protection laws : 1. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : This case established that creditors must provide complete and accurate documentation when reporting to credit bureaus. Failure to do so undermines the consumer 's rights and violates federal law. 
Request for Action To resolve this matter, I request that Kikoff : 1. Provide complete and verifiable evidence of the alleged late payments, including transactional records, timestamped payment logs, and proof of notifications sent to me regarding account status and payment issues.

2. Conduct a thorough investigation of the disputed late payments as required under the FCRA and provide a detailed explanation of your findings.

3. Remove any inaccurate or unverifiable late payment notations from my credit report.

4. Clarify the terms and conditions referenced in your response and how they justify your reporting practices in this case.

5. Provide documentation regarding the closure of my account, including details of any adverse action taken and notifications provided to me.

Potential Consumer Protection Violations If these issues are not addressed promptly and appropriately, I reserve the right to escalate this matter further. I am prepared to take this dispute to arbitration, which will significantly increase costs for your company. Arbitration costs, including fees for arbitrators and legal representation, could outweigh the resources required to resolve this dispute amicably. I may also file additional complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and consider legal remedies to enforce my rights under the FCRA and other applicable laws.

Response Deadline Please respond to this letter with all requested documentation and evidence within 30 days of receipt. Failure to comply may result in further action to protect my rights and resolve this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this issue. I look forward to your prompt and satisfactory response.

11/11/2024,Debt collection,Other debt,Communication tactics,"You told them to stop contacting you, but they keep trying","I returned a call from XXXX with Starmark Financial on XX/XX/year>. I first left a voicemail explaining to send me debt verification and purchase agreement to prove they own the debit and that I should be taking with them. I said once I review that I would talk and work with them with a payment plan assuming its owed. I also requested them to stop harassing my ex mother in law for info on me and my ex wife. 

XXXX called back immediately after I hung up. He had not heard the voicemail I left. I spoke to XXXX and explained that I would be happy to talk with him about my debt once he sends the debt validation info with the purchase agreement. He said we have sent info via email many times and you have opened. I said maybe I'm not sure but what I am asking for now is for you to mail me that info for review and then once reviewed I would work with him and company if valid. He said no we have emailed it. He asked why I stopped making payments, I said I had financial issues w some debit and was needing to put food on my table. He scoffed and said that is not good enough reason. This wasn't a gift, was it. I said no I understand that. So again, what is reason. I explained my reason stands that I need to food for family. Again I get Im not happy about not paying but and willing to work things out but his service customer service, tone, talking down to me was repulsive and I just said I am done w this conversation. Per his opening this was recorded so there should be a copy of this conversation. He was very combative. Maybe I was to or became that, but I was getting no answer about my right to have info mailed to me for review. 

I then immediately sent an email to that company asking for management to reach out to me to discuss this. 

The tone and talking to me like that when I am obviously struggling w bills since not paying that one was just so rude.

11/11/2024,Debt collection,I do not know,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Sued you in a state where you do not live or did not sign for the debt,"To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a formal complaint against Rubin & Rothman , LLC, regarding their alleged unfair and unlawful collection practices, as well as potential violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. This complaint specifically addresses Rubin & Rothman, LLCs ( the collector ) attempts to collect on a debt purportedly owed to XXXX XXXX, and XXXX alleged issuance of a 1099-C form to the IRS without notifying me. 

1. Failure to Provide 1099-C Notification : XXXX XXXX . appears to have filed a 1099-C form with the IRS in relation to this debt. Under IRS rules, creditors who issue a 1099-C form must provide the debtor with a copy. However, I never received such notice, leaving me unaware of any potential cancellation of debt income reported to the IRS. This oversight may affect the legal status of the alleged debt and my credit report, which under the FCRA must accurately reflect all pertinent information related to a debt. 
2. Violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : Rubin & Rothman, LLCs actions may be in violation of the FCRA, specifically : Inaccurate Reporting of Debt : The FCRA mandates that credit information must be accurate and complete ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ). Due to XXXX apparent filing of a 1099-C, Rubin & Rothman , LLC may be reporting a debt that has been discharged or forgiven, leading to a potentially inaccurate credit report entry. 
Failure to Provide Debt Validation : Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ), I am entitled to a validation of the debt. However, despite my request, Rubin & Rothman , LLC has failed to provide me with a debt validation letter, creating further uncertainty about the legitimacy of this debt. 
3. Improper Venue and Lack of Jurisdiction to Sue in New York : Rubin & Rothman , LLC has filed a lawsuit against me in the state of New York, despite the fact that I am a resident of Ohio.

Since I do not reside in New York and did not sign the contract in New York, this lawsuit constitutes an improper venue and is thus unlawful. 
4. Lack of Authorization to Collect in New York : Rubin & Rothman , LLC has yet to provide evidence of their authorization to collect this debt in New York, where they have initiated litigation. Under the FDCPA, debt collectors are required to prove their authority to collect, especially when jurisdiction is in question.

11/4/2024,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"Subject : Formal Complaint for Removal of Inaccurate Account Information and Compensation Request Re : Unauthorized Data Reporting and Violation of Consumer Rights under the FCRA Dear To whom it may concern I am writing to formally dispute and demand the immediate removal of inaccurate information from my credit report in accordance with my rights as a federally protected consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Additionally, I am officially opting out of any and all authorizations I may have previously grantedwhether written, unwritten, verbal, or non-verbalregarding the reporting of information that does not comply with federal law. 
Legal Basis for Removal Pursuant to 16 CFR Part 313 ( Privacy of Consumer Financial Information ) and 16 CFR Part 433 ( Preservation of Consumers ' Claims and Defenses ), I am asserting the following : 16 CFR Part 313 mandates the protection of consumer financial information and restricts the unauthorized sharing of personal data.

16 CFR Part 433 ensures that consumers ' claims and defenses are preserved, prohibiting the inclusion of unfair or deceptive acts or practices by data furnishers in credit reporting. Specifically, 16 CFR 433.2 ( a ) requires any holder of a consumer credit contract to be subject to all claims and defenses the debtor could assert against the original seller.

Unauthorized Reporting of Charge-Off Accounts Under FCRA regulations, a charge-off should not appear on my credit report as it represents a certificate of indebtedness or an accounting adjustment, which in legal terms can be categorized as income and therefore should not be reported to credit bureaus. The report of this charge-off represents an inaccurate portrayal of my financial standing and an unauthorized disclosure of my private information. 
Request for Deletion and Compensation I hereby demand the following : Immediate Deletion of any charge-offs or similarly misclassified accounts that violate 16 CFR Parts 313 and 433, FCRA, and the Truth in Lending Act.

Compensation for the violation of my rights as a consumer due to the unauthorized reporting of inaccurate information. The impact of this erroneous reporting has affected my creditworthiness and caused me undue stress and inconvenience.

Confirmation in writing that all inaccurate and unauthorized information has been removed from my credit file and details regarding the compensation process. 
Notice of Preservation of Consumer Claims and Defenses As per 16 CFR 433.2, please note the following provision applies : NOTICEANY HOLDER OF THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED PURSUANT HERETO OR WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF. RECOVERY HEREUNDER BY THE DEBTOR SHALL NOT EXCEED AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DEBTOR HEREUNDER. 
Failure to respond to this request may lead to further action to enforce my rights as a consumer, including but not limited to legal avenues.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I expect confirmation of these changes and a response regarding compensation within XXXX  days, as per the FCRA 's required response timeline.

In XXXX, I received a letter from Amsher Collections instructing me to call before XX/XX/XXXX if the account was not mine or if there was incorrect information being reported.

2. I never owed {$2200.00} at the time of closure ; the remaining balance was paid in full to XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they unlocked my IMEI number to be able to move carrier.

- The debt continues to be reported as a collections account on all three of my credit bureau reports. 
- I called Amsher four times to dispute the debt and request a debt validation letter, but neither has been provided. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX, an Amsher representative acknowledged inconsistencies with the account and assured me it would be removed. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Amsher again and was told that they no longer handle the account and that a law firm is now responsible for it.

Although initially hesitant due to the late hour, the manager eventually agreed to assist me after I explained the situation. 
I OPENED AND PAID FOR A ONE-TIME PREPAID ACCOUNT FOR A XXXX XXXX XXXX. This allowed us to resume accepting card payments after the outage. However, in XX/XX/year>, I discovered a collection listed on my credit report from XXXX, which negatively impacted my credit score.

Despite my previous communications and requests for resolution, I have encountered significant issues with how my account has been managed. Specifically, my concerns include abusive, harassing, or unfair collection practices, such as excessive phone calls, threats, or deceptive tactics used to pressure you into paying. The collector has violated consumer protection laws, such as failing to provide required disclosures, not honoring requests for verification, or engaging in illegal collection practices. 

Here are the details of my account and concerns : Account Number : N/A ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( January Technologies ) Description of Issues. 

The collector has not provided the necessary documentation to validate the debt despite repeated requests. I have previously requested the collector to provide proof that the debt is valid, including documentation showing the original creditor, the amount owed, and their right to collect the debt. 

As a result, I believe that filing a complaint with the CFPB and potentially other regulatory bodies is necessary to address my concerns. 

I would like to resolve this matter amicably and request that you take the following actions : Address and resolve the specific issues outlined above. 

Provide a formal response to this letter within 15 days detailing how you plan to resolve these issues. 

Provide any relevant documentation that supports your position regarding the issues raised.

11/4/2024,Credit card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card,"This complaint is a continuation of a closed investigation previously filed with the CFPB - XXXX XXXX. In that complaint I stated that I was scammed by an online lawyer service on a site named XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I tried to get legal advice for a concern I had, for a {$5.00} fee I was told it would be, for a XXXX week trial period. The answer was bogus, unhelpful, and I complained to a representative on their site both over the phone and in writing the very same day. I was offered the opportunity to have my question addressed to another online attorney, which I declined and I immediately declined the remainder of the week long trial. I was charged {$69.00}, for a full month membership, which I did not know anything about. Despite several resolution attempts on my part with them, they refused. I contacted the credit card company, Macy 's Amex, and, to this day, they have not offered a resolution, despite several hours of attempts on the phone, in online chats and requests for them to put something in writing about the {$69.00} charge I was disputing. 

Moving forward, this is still the case. As a matter of fact, I feel my rights have been violated. To my surprise, this year a number of charges totaling close to {$200.00} were made to my Amex card. When I go online, all I see are my Macy 's charges, not the ones made outside of this. Somehow, one day I managed to get access to this, surprised to find out that someone else was using my card on a fairly regular basis this year to pay off things that appear to be video games related. The woman I spoke to was very helpful and stayed on the phone with me for nearly 2 hours, going back as far as XX/XX/XXXX to see how long these charges were going on for, helping me get back over {$180.00} for 5 individual ongoing XXXX XXXX charges. She addressed the unresolved {$69.00} fraud dispute that was listed as such, for a year and a half. She attempted to put this complaint through again, since it was still left open. I attempted a total of 3 times again this year to get a response, only to be told that it appears this dispute is still "" pending ''. 

Since then, a new card was issued to me and I was instructed to keep making payments to the account ending in XXXX. I told them that I would pay for everything, barring the {$69.00} in question, and I was told that I couldn't do that, that Macy 's require ongoing payments, and even if I pay it all off, I would still be reimbursed the disputed charge. The account for XXXX has officially been paid off. Now i have a new account ending in XXXX. It does not appear to tie into the previous account, because I have had nothing but issues since receiving the new card. I had to call to activate the card because online this card was saying that it was invalid and that I had to call in to activate it. Macy 's Star Rewards and coupons that I had on my Macy 's wallet on the account XXXX did not transfer over to the XXXX account without my calling a representative. I signed up for payment due notifications, which I no longer was receiving with the new card and I am incurring late fees of {$29.00} regularly, with no warning. I have a history of either paying off my balance in full, or making larger payments than the amount due amounts, so I was shocked to find that Macy 's has frozen my card because I was late making a {$29.00} payment that was due last week for a balance due of about {$250.00}. In the past, over the years, I would either have gotten a call or, at the very least, a mailing, letting me know a payment was due. This is no longer the case. And if I hadn't been attempting to make a {$40.00} online purchase, I would not have known that my account was frozen and I was told to call in. It was then that I was told by a representative, at XXXXXXXX XXXX this morning on XX/XX/XXXX, that my account will remain frozen until I make a payment. 

Presently, as of XX/XX/XXXX, I still do not have access to view my XXXX statement to see what charges, outside of Macy 's online purchases, have been made. The woman would not provide me with information on anything else and reluctantly let me know that at least one late fee was applied to my account. She said if I made a payment now, she would see if she could "" grant '' me a "" courtesy removal '' of "" one '' {$29.00} late fee. She could not answer why I am no longer getting payment due notification alerts, that I signed up for several times. 

I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that informed me the investigation on my Macy 's American Express card was completed and that the disputed charge was removed. Of course, because I am unable to access my account in full online, I can not see if the resolved dispute charge was the {$69.00} because the letter omits that information. 

I need assistance in getting this {$69.00} disputed charge resolved. I want to report my card being frozen for a missed payment. I want to report that I am not getting payment reminder alerts that I have signed up for online and that I am repeatedly being charged {$29.00} late fees that I have been unknowingly paying. I want an investigation done on the credit card policy that Macy 's has that I am required to make monthly payments on my account- even for the disputed charge amounts. Since trying to resolve this dispute from XX/XX/XXXX with Macy 's Amex, I've done everything the way CFPB advised. I've called to speak with supervisors, put my complaint in writing, followed up repeatedly, and continued paying balances in full without resolution. I do not know what to do next.

Then the Trans Union rep said "" well maybe they offered you a job ''.

Trans Union rep could not or would not tell me who had made this inquiry and suggested that I call the city of XXXX and ask them - good luck- he didn't know what the XXXX code was either. 

Then he started babbling about how anyone I have had financial dealings with can pull my credit. I said no, I was a XXXX XXXX  for over 20 years and I KNOW how this stuff works.

11/5/2024,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Id like to file a complaint against Barclays ( GAP ) Mastercard for looking out for their companys best interest instead of myself ( the consumer ). 


I ordered seven clothing items from Old Navy on XX/XX/XXXX ( order # XXXX ) for a total of {$110.00}. My order was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX with five out of the seven items missing. My package was taped shut like it had been tampered with and someone haphazardlywrapped the package in shipping tape. There was also an internal XXXX  XXXX ( shipping ) HUB sticker inside my resealed package showing someone had been in my package between the ( GAP ) warehouse and myself. 
After speaking with customer service reps on XX/XX/XXXX and having my missing items claim denied, a GAP representative told me my only course of action was to dispute the charge with my credit card company but otherwise the case is closed and I'm out {$76.00}. They had no interest in the pictures I took of my package. A customer service rep alluded to me that since I have a GAP card, and GAP will do the 'internal "" investigation with my disputed charge, I don't stand a chance at a refund. This is a conflict of interest. I filed with the BBB and the case was eventually closed without a resolution. I insisted this was a shipping issue, not a credit issue. 
It was reiterated to me continuously from customer service reps from GAP that they can not and will not offer a refund ; I can only dispute the charge. 

Enter Barclays : - I talked with GAP Barclays credit card customer service on XX/XX/XXXX to initially dispute the charge @ XXXX. I talked to XXXX to review the missing items. 
- I returned a missed call & message on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX and spoke to both XXXX & XXXX to again review the missing items. 
- I returned a missed call & message on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX and spoke to XXXX. XXXX alerted me I would receive a credit for my missing order in the amount of {$59.00}. I told her that was not the full amount and she insisted it was only a partial refund but I would receive the entire {$76.00} back. 
- I missed a call on XX/XX/XXXX but no message or number was left. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter in the mail from Barclays GAP Mastercard stating my case has been closed and was decided against me in part because of no communication on my part. This is untrue. I have phone logs of myself calling and talking to their representatives. They also notified me they would be taking back the {$59.00} they credited me on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The proof Old Navy/GAP provided were tiny screenshot printouts of my account charges, a fragmented sentence stating based on weight all items were included, and a tracking number showing the package was delivered. They absolutely closed the claim without sufficient evidence since my claim was for missing items. 
- I spoke to XXXX from Barclays today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) who confirmed the case was closed and I can only mail or fax a letter to ask for my case to reopened. I have XXXX interest in continuing the charade that this will be taken care of appropriately. 

It certainly questions the relationship between Barclays GAP ( store ) credit card and a GAP owned company. Especially after the customer service rep mentioned/threatened this would happen. How exactly did they find in their own favor with scant evidence? I was not and am not protected in any of these situations. GAP knew by pushing me to dispute the charge, there was no way they would be found at fault when theyre investigating themselves. They unilaterally decided my case wasnt valid without any recourse.

Unhappy with my decision, the finance lady left the room in frustration and went to get the XXXX to try to convince me, I called my husband and he agreed we didnt need to get additional warranty, so I said no, the XXXX then took back the XXXX months warranty that he initially told my husband and I was included, and suggested I needed the extended warranty that came with the second loan option. When the XXXX people that were already in the room could not convince me, the owner of the dealership came in and printed out papers showing me peoples experience on the cost of auto repair, he even offered to pay me back the money for the warranty if I didnt use it, I still refused.

Lastly, the finance lady had me sign the papers, then informed me that she included reported and additional income of XXXX a month on my loan application, income I did not report because its nonexistent.

11/10/2024,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Closing disclosure or other related disclosures,"Complaint 1 : MERS Inactivity and Demand for Validation Complaint Overview This complaint addresses M & T Bank 's inactive status in the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems ( MERS ) despite collecting payments for over XXXX years. This inactivity raises significant concerns regarding M & T Bank 's legal standing and authority to collect payments, and it follows issues outlined in prior demand letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
Details of Complaint XXXX. Lack of Standing and XXXX XXXX M & T Bank 's inactive status in MERS violates transparency requirements under federal statutes, including TILA ( Truth in Lending Act ), RESPA ( Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ), FDCPA ( Federal Debt Collection Practices Act ), and FCRA ( Federal Credit Reporting Act ). This lack of transparency clouds the title and deprives me of my right to know the legal holder of the mortgage and promissory note. 
2. Request for MERS Milestone Report I am requesting a full MERS Milestone ( MAL ) report under the Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) provision, detailing all transfers of the mortgage and promissory note to validate M & T Bank 's authority as the servicer and establish its legal standing.

3. Ongoing Financial Burden The financial impact of these actions is substantial, with payments expected to continue through XXXX. Payments to an unverified servicer have caused financial hardship and distress, affecting trust resources and stability. Due to M & T Bank 's inactivity in MERS and lack of required settlement disclosure, I have incurred financial losses, including increased payments and higher interest rates. 
4. Emotional Distress Calculation To quantify emotional distress, I assign a daily rate of {$100.00}, beginning from the onset of hardship on XX/XX/XXXX, amounting to approximately XXXX days to date : Calculation : {$100.00} ( daily rate ) x XXXX ( days ) = {$100000.00}. 
This reflects the emotional and ongoing distress directly resulting from M & T Bank 's actions and inactions. 
5. Unjust Enrichment and Bad Faith Since the closing date of XX/XX/XXXX, I have tendered payments in good faith, expecting proper handling and documentation. M & T Banks failure to provide essential documentation jeopardizes my financial standing and suggests unjust enrichment and potential bad faith. The ongoing collection without validated legal standing benefits M & T Bank unjustly at my expense. 

Resolution Requested I request immediate restitution based on the following monthly calculation of {$940.00}, totaling approximately {$45000.00} over XXXX years : XXXX Total : {$11000.00} XXXX Total : {$11000.00} XXXX Total : {$11000.00} XXXX Total : {$11000.00} Additionally, I request XXXX XXXX M & T Bank 's standing through a MERS Milestone report, relief from future obligations under this loan due to violations and lack of transparency, and emotional distress compensation totaling approximately {$100000.00}. 



Complaint XXXX : Settlement Disclosure Provided After Closing Complaint Overview This complaint concerns M & T Banks failure to provide a required settlement disclosure until after closing, in violation of my rights under TILA, RESPA, and FDCPA. Despite this documents omission by the original lender XXXX M & T Bank, as the current servicer, is responsible for providing it under the Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) provision. I am formally requesting complete copies of all closing documents related to my propertys mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX, as required. 
Details of Complaint XXXX. Violation of XXXX XXXX M & T Banks failure to provide a timely settlement disclosure impacts my right to understand loan terms, informed consent, and protection from unauthorized collection practices. As the mortgage servicer, M & T Bank must ensure I receive the necessary settlement closing document under my QWR. 
XXXX. Financial and Emotional Damages The absence of this disclosure has caused substantial financial losses, credit denials, increased loan and insurance rates, and compounded financial obligations. Additionally, these actions have led to significant emotional distress, affecting trust resources, peace of mind, and well-being as I navigate these unresolved issues. 
XXXX. Unjust XXXX and XXXX XXXX M & T Banks failure to provide required disclosures and continued collection of payments since closing suggests bad faith and unjust enrichment. Despite acting in good faith by making payments, M & T Banks failure to disclose has benefited them at my expense. 
Resolution Requested I request immediate compensation of approximately {$25000.00}, calculated as follows : Emotional Distress Compensation : An estimated {$10000.00} for prolonged distress due to credit denials, financial strain, and collection activities resulting from M & T Banks failure to provide proper documentation. 
Financial Losses : Approximately {$8000.00} due to increased interest rates on credit and higher insurance premiums stemming from credit damage due to inaccurate reporting. 
Additionally, I request a setoff to balance the ledger due to overpayments under incorrect servicing terms and M & T Bank 's failure to validate debt ownership, including : Setoff Amount : The setoff amount includes approximately {$110000.00}, reflecting the initial mortgage balance from XX/XX/XXXX, and {$25000.00} for a partial claim mortgage established on XX/XX/XXXX, which lacks my authorization. This total setoff reflects unauthorized debt obligations and unvalidated collection practices.

11/18/2024,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"In a recent investigation into banking policies, I discovered that, according to the deposit agreements of major financial institutions such as XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, an account may be closed if it remains inactive or maintains a XXXX balance. Even when an account has a balance, minimal engagement in activitiessuch as online transfers or depositsover an extended period may lead the bank to classify the account as dormant, resulting in its closure. 

I am currently experiencing a similar issue with my BMO savings account, which is set to be closed due to my inadvertent maintenance of a XXXX balance for over 30 days. I have contacted both customer service and the nearest branch in an attempt to prevent this action ; however, I was informed that there are no measures that can be undertaken to stop the closure. This assertion is perplexing, as I believe that most processes can be implemented or reversed. 

Additionally, it is noteworthy that the procedure for closing an account predominantly involves human intervention, suggesting that it may be possible to halt this process. I find it concerning that a financial institution, which has recently commenced operations in California and is rapidly expanding its customer base, is facing such challenges. My situation is not a result of negligence ; I attempted to transfer funds into the account only to discover that it had been removed from my online banking interface. Upon inquiring about this, I learned it is in the process of being closed, with no options for recourse.

11/8/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Pursuant to a previous complaint with Wells Fargo ( ref XXXX ) that ended up deep in my spam-box and as a result not replied to, Wells Fargo changed my checking and savings account. I can understand why in the absence of a direct deposit that my accounts were "" downgraded ''. What I can't understand is : 1 ) why I'm being charged {$5.00} per month for a savings account I can't use, because 2 ) my Wells Fargo debit card was also canceled and not replaced, and why 3 ) I can't close the savings account in a branch and save myself the {$5.00} each month.

This apparently happened several months ago. I have not received any statements from WF. I just found out this month that the card was canceled. Previous times I've paid my mortgage the card worked, allowing the teller at the branch to identify myself and my accounts.

I have no idea what the cycle is on these new accounts. ( e.g. the XXXX to the XXXX, XXXX to XXXX, other ). Further, it requires me to go into a branch, which is only open about the same time as I work, to pay the {$5.00} because I no longer have ATM access. As I am often spread thin on time between the job, XXXX family members for whom I am the sole caretaker and trying to maintain some kind of life, time gets away from me, I forget and then there's another {$5.00} deficit in that account. 

I didn't agree to this change. I wasn't notified of this change. I've received no statements for these accounts. I have no access to these accounts other than in a branch. 

I fully expect that the response to this complaint will be similar to the previous response - "" Because we can '' - but felt it important to post here at CFPB in case others are researching issues with Wells Fargo.

Please see below for a detailed account of everything that happened and will need to be thoroughly reviewed. I have been calling daily and still haven't heard back. 

On XXXX XXXX while leaving the XXXX XXXX my debit card was stolen out of my luggage by either the concierge at my hotel or XXXX. I was unaware that it was stolen as I was on a flight ( have proof of me being on a flight ) and could not have been making charges in a country I was no longer in. Upon landing, I received a fraud notification FROM BMO stating that XXXX charges were going to be processed ( others were denied for fraud automatically, have proof of this ) XXXX charge was for {$3000.00} and another for {$86.00} had been made to the same fraud name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( I have screenshots of the fraud changes email from BMO ). I promptly called BMO to turn my card off immediately and filed my fraud case once the XXXX fraud charges were posted to my account. When initially on the phone with the BMO agent I said I didn't know if my card was stolen or my account hacked again as I had just gotten off a plane and didn't have my luggage yet. When I got to my luggage and checked, the card was indeed stolen. 

It should also be noted, that the debit card HAD NEVER BEEN used before, these fraud charges were the first and only charges made on the card. Again, these were also initially correctly flagged as fraud by BMO. 

Once the charges were posted I immediately called and filed a fraud case. I did not hear back about my case so on XX/XX/year> I emailed XXXX XXXX to get an update after filing my case. While I did get an automatic response, I have yet to receive an email from an actual person with information about reopening my case. 

While checking my account, I noticed the fraud charge for {$86.00} had been refunded, but for some reason, the larger charge for {$3000.00} had been denied. This is incorrect, I can prove I was on a plane at this time and did not make either of these charges. To try and get help on XX/XX/year> Spoke with XXXX from the BMO resolution team- she never called me back to update me on my case after she said she was following up. 

On XX/XX/year> Follow-up email to Rege.processing to which I received no automatic response, nor a response from an actual person. 

As XXXX XXXX was not responding to my emails on XX/XX/year> I went into a physical branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX ) and spoke with the XXXX XXXX XXXX, He emailed Rege.processing on my behalf with all of my evidence to which he received no response and still hasn't to this day. 

On XX/XX/year> I followed up with the Branch Manager for an update. On this day he informed me my claim was denied and emailed me my claim denial and dispute case ( both attached ). It should be noted, I had NEVER received the denial prior to this day XX/XX/year>. XXXX, the branch manager said he did communicate this to BMO for my case. 

After finding out on XX/XX/year> I made a new call to BMO and spoke with XXXX with the resolutions team to try and get help. She has emailed Rege.processing on my behalf and opened a new XXXXase Call Reference # XXXX. 

On XX/XX/year> I sent a new email to XXXX XXXX for a response and looking to reopen my fraud case once again. 

Again, the fraud charge for {$86.00} was returned as it was correctly identified as fraud. I am asking BMO to please return the {$3000.00} fraud charge that was made by the same merchant at the same date/time to my account immediately.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BMO Bank, N.A.",CA,94605,None,Consent provided,Web,11/15/2024,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,10793555

11/4/2024,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Fraud Incident and Inadequate Response from USAA Bank To whom it may concern, I am reaching out to formally address an urgent matter involving a case of bank fraud and inadequate response from my bank, USAA. I have been a victim of fraudulent activity and, despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue with USAA, they have failed to safeguard my account or recover my lost funds. This negligence has led to significant financial loss and distress. 

Incident Summary On XX/XX/year>, I received a call from an individual posing as a USAA representative. This impostor informed me that there were red flags on my account, and funds had attempted to be withdrawn. They instructed me to visit a nearby physical bank, as USAA lacks a physical branch, to withdraw and deposit my funds into a new secure account they would create. Importantly, at no point did I share my PIN, password, or other account details, as they already had access to my account information. 

Preventive Measures Taken After this suspicious interaction, I contacted USAA immediately on the following day to confirm the legitimacy of this call. USAA verified that this was indeed an impostor and assured me they would red-flag my account. They advised me to change my PIN, username, and password, and I did so multiple times. I also followed their directive to unlink and deactivate any devices, as well as XXXX XXXX connections, to further protect my account. 

USAAs AssurancXXXX and Failed Security Promises On XX/XX/XXXX, a suspicious pending transaction appeared in my account, which I promptly reported to USAAs fraud department. Despite being reassured that my account was flagged and the transaction would be blocked, I later discovered that my entire balance was transferred out. I contacted USAA immediately, and they promised to prevent the transaction from completing. However, despite these reassurances, my funds were ultimately withdrawn without intervention. 

USAAs Failure to Take Responsibility When I called again on XX/XX/XXXX, a USAA representative informed me that they might hold me responsible for the loss, despite my following all their security instructions and diligently reporting each suspicious activity. USAA had ample opportunity to protect my account and prevent this loss, yet they failed to take timely action. I feel doubly victimized : first by the fraudsters and then by USAAs failure to secure my funds. 

Conclusion This entire experience has been distressing and financially damaging. I am seeking the BBBs assistance to hold USAA accountable for their negligence and to ensure my lost funds are restored. USAAs lack of action and delayed responses have severely impacted my trust, and I believe they must take responsibility for their oversight. 

Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter. I appreciate any assistance you can provide in ensuring that USAA upholds its commitment to protect its customers.

11/5/2024,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Consumer Complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Account Closure by US Bank and Lack of Access to Funds I am writing to file a formal complaint against US Bank ( Bank Branch : [ Not known ) due to the unexpected closure of my account, which resulted in my inability to access the funds in my account. Despite numerous attempts to contact the bank, I have not received a clear explanation for the account closure nor have I been provided access to my funds. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that my account ( Account Number : XXXX ) had been closed by US Bank without prior notice. I was not informed of the reason for the closure, nor did I receive any written notification from the bank. This has caused significant financial inconvenience, as I have been unable to access my remaining balance or transfer the funds to another account. 

As a consumer, I am entitled to protection under both Missouri law and federal regulations regarding the closure of my account and access to my funds. Specifically, I believe the following laws are relevant to my case : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Closure Laws Under Missouri Revised Statutes 362.410, a bank has the right to close an account, but must do so in accordance with the terms of the account agreement. Generally, a bank is required to provide reasonable notice of account closure, particularly if the closure results in the account holder being unable to access their funds. Failure to notify a customer, as is the case in this instance, may be in violation of this law.

2. Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E The Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq., and Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. Part 1005, govern electronic fund transfers, including withdrawals, deposits, and other transactions involving consumer accounts. Under these laws, a financial institution must provide clear information about the closure of an account, as well as ensure that the consumer has access to their remaining funds. If an account is closed and there are funds remaining, the bank is required to facilitate the withdrawal or transfer of those funds promptly.

3. The Right to Access Your Funds Under Missouri law, when a consumer 's account is closed, they are still entitled to access the funds in the account. If the bank closes an account without providing proper notice, it must ensure that the account holder is able to retrieve their funds. This is especially important if the closure was not initiated due to fraud or a legitimate breach of contract.

4. Consumer Protection Under the D
odd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices by financial institutions. The failure to notify a customer about the closure of an account and withholding access to their funds could be viewed as an unfair practice under this law, which is subject to investigation by the CFPB or relevant state authorities. 

Request for Immediate Action In light of the laws outlined above, I respectfully request that the Missouri Division of Finance investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that US Bank complies with state and federal regulations regarding account closure and access to funds. Specifically, I request the following : A thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the closure of my account by US Bank.

A detailed explanation from US Bank regarding why my account was closed without prior notice, in violation of the terms of the account agreement and applicable laws.

Immediate access to my remaining balance, either by check or through a transfer to another account that I designate.

Written confirmation from US Bank outlining the steps being taken to resolve this issue. 
If this matter is not resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner, I will consider pursuing additional recourse through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other legal channels. 

Please contact me at XXXX or [ your email address ] for further information or if you require any additional documentation. I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter and to receiving a resolution as soon as possible.

In XXXX, I purchased a pet from XXXX XXXX XXXX, located in XXXX, VA, with the hope of adding a joyful companion to my family. Unfortunately, what began as an exciting experience quickly turned into an emotional and financial nightmare. 

Upon visiting the store, my daughter and I played with the puppy for an hour, bonding with him and deciding he would be a perfect fit for our family. However, I was quoted an unexpected price of {$7500.00} for the puppy. After being reassured by the company that the dog was completely healthy, had all required vaccinations, and was free of any health issues, I decided to proceed. I paid half of the amount upfront and agreed to finance the remaining balance. 

Within just a month of taking the puppy home, he began to exhibit alarming symptomsXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I took him to the vet repeatedly, incurring substantial expenses, only to learn that the puppy had a serious XXXX XXXX that likely existed since birth. The veterinarian informed me that this was not an XXXX  that could have developed suddenly. 

I immediately reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX  to report the issue, only to be told that since their 3-day return window had passed, there was nothing they could do. At the 3-day mark, there were no visible signs that the puppy was unwell. Despite my efforts to care for him, the puppy tragically passed away shortly afterward. This loss was devastating for me and my young daughter, who had quickly formed a deep bond with him. 

**Legal Concerns : ** I believe thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  actions may constitute violations of several consumer protection laws, which I would like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to investigate : 1. **Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices ( UDAP ) ** under the **Federal Trade Commission Act ( Section 5 ) ** : - XXXX XXXX XXXX misrepresented the health of the pet, assuring me it was in good condition, despite evidence that the dog was ill. Selling a sick pet under false pretenses could be considered an unfair and deceptive business practice. 

2. **The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act** : - XXXX XXXX  XXXX failed to provide me with any documentation or shot records for the puppy. By selling me a dog that was not healthy as promised, they breached the implied warranty of merchantability, which requires that goods be fit for their intended purpose. 

3. **The Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) - Implied Warranty of Merchantability** : - The puppy was not fit for the purpose of being a healthy pet, as implied during the sale. The fact that the puppy died from a condition likely present since birth indicates a breach of this warranty. 

4. **The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ** : - The financing company is currently pursuing me for the remaining balance of {$3000.00} on a dog that died due to the seller 's misrepresentation. Under the FDCPA, continuing to collect a debt that is associated with an unfair or deceptive transaction may be unlawful.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Rozlin Financial Group, Inc.",MD,20716,None,Consent provided,Web,11/20/2024,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10856440

Had I been fully informed of these consequences, I would have reconsidered my options. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that my credit score had dropped drastically, from XXXX to XXXX, due to this assistance program. This unexpected decline in my credit score has created a lasting financial burden, as it affects my access to credit and raises costs on essential financing. 

Upon contacting U.S. Bank to discuss the issue, I was told by a representative that they were sorry I didnt get the full information. I find this response unsatisfactory, as it implies that the burden of understanding program limitations was on me, even though I relied on U.S. Banks guidance in a time of crisis. 

In light of the above, I request that U.S. Bank take the following actions : Amend my credit report to reflect that the payment pause was part of an assistance program and not a delinquency, in order to mitigate the severe impact on my credit score. 
Ensure clear communication for all future assistance programs, specifically detailing any potential impact on customers credit reports, so that others do not face similar issues. 
Provide confirmation of the steps taken to correct the reporting error on my account. 
I trust that U.S. Bank values its customers and understands the extraordinary circumstances that arise after natural disasters. I hope you will review this matter with urgency and compassion and take appropriate action to resolve my concerns. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and to working together toward a resolution.
